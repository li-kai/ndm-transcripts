The Naturalistic Decision Making podcast with Brian Moon and Laura Millatello. This podcast series brings you interviews with leading NDM researchers who study and support people who make decisions under stress.
Welcome to the Naturalistic Decision Making podcast. This is Brian Moon from Paraan Technologies.
And I'm Laura Millatello from Applied Decision Science.
This is our 51st podcast. And so, just for fun, we're going to switch things up. Our special guest, Gary Klein is going to facilitate the session. He's going to ask us questions as we reflect on the last 50 NDM podcasts. So with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Thank you, Laura. Thank you both of you, Brian and Laura for inviting me to be involved in this podcast. And you invited me, so my first question is, why are we doing this podcast? What do you hope to accomplish with it?
So, I think we wanted to just pause and celebrate having completed 50 podcasts and and reflect a little bit. So, we've received a lot of good feedback that suggests the podcast is reaching all sorts of people we never imagined. Like, Cedric Chan, who's this business consultant in Singapore, he reached out to us after hearing the podcast and reading some of our work. My sister-in-law who works for a nonprofit found her way to the podcast. She said, she must have like loaded it up on a list somewhere in a queue and she was on a plane listening to something and fell asleep and woke up to hear us talking to Gergiger. So, yeah, it just seemed like a good time to kind of reflect and think about how fun this has been and all the cool people we've met.
Not to mention our five-star reviews that we've received on countless podcast platforms. We we do get some good reviews in in the formal sense and like Laura, I've just had people say, I listen to your podcast all the time and it surprises me because truth be told, I'm not a huge podcast listener. And so, the fact that others are actually out there listening to us is pretty astonishing to me. So, yeah, I think like Laura said, we've done 50 and just kind of time to look back and also look forward a bit to think about what we want to do next.
Okay, excellent. Thank you. So, you've done 50, 51 of these so far, over a period of what, over four years or more. When did you start?
Four years, our very first one with you. It's actually, we released it, I think April 20th, 2020. So, early sort of pandemic days and that was part I think of the initiative to get things started is we wanted to make sure we were staying in touch with colleagues during that time.
Yeah, and also Brian had suggested the idea of a podcast before 2020 and the shutdown, but I thought it was a good idea, but I was very intimidated. Like it just seemed hard and big. And then somehow while we were all shut down and no one was traveling, Brian raised it again and all of a sudden it seemed possible and and like an exciting project. So, I was glad we got started then.
Mhm. It's it's impressive that you've kept it going for four years and going beyond the I'll start with you, Brian. When you started, did you imagine that you would be doing this for four years now?
We did not have four years worth of guests in mind. No. We we sort of had our our handful of uh let's just call them NDM regulars and that's basically where we started is is sort of talking to the folks that we knew. But yeah, I mean, that's a pretty long time to run any sort of program like this. But I think it really has been a matter of sort of rolling forward from the folks that we know to things that we're interested in that we're seeing other people talk about. So that I think is helped us to expand the scope, but I certainly was not intending to do this for four years. And obviously some other things have happened in the meantime with NDM sorts of things. So, it it feels like we've grown quite a bit from this little kernel of our project.
So, if you had known at the beginning, Laura, that this was going to be going on for four years and beyond, you would have been even more intimidated about it. It's true. It's true. Just as well you didn't know.
It's true. Yes.
All right. So, you've been doing this for four years. I'll start with you, Laura. How do you think the podcasts have changed over time?
So, as Brian mentioned, the very first ones were kind of thought leaders in the NDM community, people we know and who have really, you know, been the folks who are carrying the charge, you and Robert Hoffman and Alley Roth and those folks, David Woods, and so that was really fun, but over time we have now expanded to reaching out to folks who maybe don't even know NDM or only know it peripherally, but we find that their work is really interesting and related and we're talking to more practitioners. So, I think that's been one big change is we're just getting broader and making really fun links and connections.
Brian, your thoughts?
Same, we actually haven't changed the format that much. And and I think that's been intentional. I think it's been intentional. But I I think the beauty of the format is that we're not just hearing about research and projects and findings, but we're getting to know people as well. And that's been the fun part for me is is sort of hearing people talk about how they got into NDM to begin with and what their inspirations are. And I think we've heard a number of themes. The theme that stands out to me the most is I didn't start out on NDM, I sort of stumbled upon it. That keeps coming up. So, maybe that tells us something. But we haven't really changed the format much and I think that that's been useful, certainly easier to prepare for these sorts of things. But I think when people get familiar, they sort of know what's coming as well. And so, in as much as the people have changed, I think we're if you listen to early podcasts, they're going to at least in structure sound very similar to later ones and maybe that's also just the fact that we both do interviews and so we're used to having a semi-structured approach to these sorts of things.
But I do like our framework. I like hearing how people got started. I love those stories and what they're excited about today and what they're looking forward to next. Those I think are the three kind of big picture framework topics and yeah, those are always fun conversations, so I think it works.
So, it sounds to me like one of the driving forces is your genuine curiosity. That you're not just doing podcasts, you want to find these things out and you want to learn more about the people you're interviewing and and that creates the freshness.
Absolutely. Yeah.
Okay, I have a question I'll have for both of you but I'll start with you, Brian. What are some of the exciting things that you've learned that that have stuck with you as you've been doing this over the four years.
Yeah, I think again, the sort of origin stories have been really interesting because especially with sort of first generation NDM folks, you know, who who had some kind of, I don't know if it's an epiphany or some sort of moment in their career where they realized, you know, this traditional way of doing psychology research is is not working for me and they sort of gradually found NDM or in some cases founded NDM. But I think that's a really interesting theme and I think as we move forward and talk to folks who sort of second generation or even as Laura suggested folks that don't know much about NDM, just hearing how they came to it as well. I mean, we're we're actively now going out and and trying to find people whose work parallels, I think, we think, the work of NDM. And so, we may shift from this, you know, initial origin story approach that the early folks shared with us to more of how do we how do we create origin stories for other people outside of NDM. So, that so that's been, I think, an interesting piece. And then just the personal stuff that people have shared and we always ask that one or more fun questions at the end and just to hear people sort of share a personal I I really enjoyed when we talked to Dave Woods hearing about his work with, you know, Renaissance Fairs and and that sort of thing. And so, people have we've just learned a lot about uh people that we didn't know about personally.
Okay, but digging a little bit more into the origin story, can you think of any specific origin stories that kind of struck you, Brian?
I don't know about any specific ones, but as I I mentioned that sort of theme, it was just stark to hear about the epiphanyes that people had and and when they sort of got to these points in their careers where they realized that what they were doing wasn't going to work out, right? And they they couldn't sort of learn the things that they thought they needed to learn. Yeah, I'm I'm struggling to think of individual origin stories, but that one just kept coming up time and time again.
Okay, thank you. And Laura, same question for you. Some of the exciting things, whether they're origin stories or other kinds of things that you heard that have stuck with you.
Yeah, so I actually you sent these questions ahead and so I actually sat down and kind of made a list just top of head things that I remembered, which is kind of fun. They're mostly things about people's lives. So, Missy Cummings talked about being part of the social upheaval in the 1980s as she was getting started, she was one of the very very first female fighter pilots and she talked about the bitterness and anger that she dealt with from people who were not ready for that kind of change. That was fascinating to hear about. Penny Sanderson told us she's an expert at mixing drinks. Kathy Moser started her career as a flight attendant. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then went and got a PhD and then studied aviation from an NDM perspective for many years. Leah Debella told us she's a fourth generation entrepreneur. And so that was interesting to me because I first met Leah when she was finishing her PhD and she came to Klein Associates and gave a talk and had done this fascinating research and then to watch her build this company that has focused on training executives, you know, the whole entrepreneurial theme mixed with her research, it was cool to hear that piece of the puzzle. Simon Henderson told us that he when he was 10 years old, one almost one, like came runner up for the UK clue, the board game clue, which is called Cludo in the UK. So there was a national championship. He was the runner up. He was 10 years old and if he'd won, he would have gotten to the European championship. He almost made it to Paris. Everyone else was, you know, much, much older than him. He was the youngest person there. And and then he went on to have a career studying deception, which is part of that clue game, right, fooling your opponent. So, Eduardo Salas said if he hadn't become a researcher, he might have been a chef. Joel Sust told us that, you know, he works in law enforcement and worked really hard to make his way into that domain and get credibility and one way he did that was volunteering to be pepper sprayed and tased. Now that's dedication to field research. Yes. Jan Martin Schragan told us that when he did some graduate work at Carnegie Melon University and when he and his wife were living there, they had a guinea pig pet and they named the the guinea pig after the robot in the lab at Carnegie Melon. So, anyway, those are the kinds of details that like came to the top of my mind as as I pondered this question of what sticks with me.
Those are great stories. Okay. And before I go on, Brian, has this stimulated any memories and specific memories in you? No, not really.
Mhm. No, but as Laura was obviously done her homework, she was rattling those off. I realized that we've really touched on some pivotal moments in the history of of psychology here. Right. Right. So, what are some of the disappointments, if you can think of any? You're certainly legitimately very pleased with the podcasts, but can you think of any disappointments looking back over the four years? And I'll start with you again, Brian.
Yeah, I don't know if I'd say we've had any disappointments. I will say we reached out to a couple people who have declined participating. The reasons are everything from, gosh, I just don't think I'm appropriate to that makes me really nervous and I couldn't imagine doing that sort of thing, but those have only been, you know, a couple here and there. In terms of, I guess, a disappointment is in so far as we are getting lots of lots of attention, more would be even better. Every once in a while, I'll sort of look us up in terms of where we are ranked and in terms of the decision-making podcasts that are out there. We're we're usually in the top 10, but I'd like to think that we have some pretty interesting content that at least is comparable to those folks at the top. And, you know, I don't exactly know how all these podcast ranking systems work anyway, but some of them I I can't imagine what their content is because it doesn't really seem to be addressing decision making. So, I'd love for us to be the the number one decision-making podcast in the world. So, uh maybe maybe that's a disappointment or or a goal to keep striving for. But but yeah, I I think we've also every once in a while, Laura and I sort of get together and say, all right, who else is on the list? Who else should we talk to? And so, maybe we're disappointing other people who are expecting us to call them to be on the podcast.
Yeah, I don't know. It's been all pretty positive. I don't know that other than those minor disappointments I have any.
So, you've made it generally into the top 10 have so you've been tracking this. How long did it take you to start getting into the top 10?
I think the first time I started looking at that was actually at the last NDM conference just sort of in preparation and uh and by then we were we were already there. So, maybe I should put a little bit more time into trying to understand how these algorithms work so that we could properly manipulate them and push ourselves up a little higher. But yeah, I mean, I do think anecdotally, we've gotten some evidence that people sort of found their way to NDM generally through the podcast. So, that's exciting. Especially when again, the initial focus was just sort of us talking to folks that we know about, you know, NDM stuff. The idea that this could be a a gateway to other engagement in the NDM community is pretty exciting. And so maybe, yeah, maybe there's more we could be doing to sort of spread the word.
So, what are you doing? How would somebody who's not affiliated with the NDM community, how would they stumble on your podcasts?
Well, if you just Google decision making podcasts, you'll you'll see us pop up. So, that's we're sort of first page of Google returns, which is a good thing. But it's funny because you look at some of those other podcasts and it's, you know, where can I listen to a podcast to figure out how to make hard life decisions? And and but there are some other decision researchers. Katy Milkman's usually pretty high if not number one all the time. So, there's there's other folks also focused on sort of decision making research like topics, but a lot of them are just sort of, where can I listen to people tell me how to make decisions in my life? So, I'm not exactly sure even what people mean by decision making podcast.
A flexible term. Laura, what about you? Can you think of any disappointments looking back over the four years?
Yeah, I couldn't really other than the first one Brian mentioned, there's some folks who really would love to talk to, who just weren't comfortable with it. So, that's a little bit disappointing. But all in all, these have turned out to be way more fun than I expected. Yeah.
Okay, and the podcast, did you ever think about adding video to make them richer?
I feel like it would just make me even more self-conscious. Personally, I don't know. Have you thought about it, Brian?
Well, I mean, you asked earlier what's changed. One thing that's changed actually is this platform we use to do the recording. And so, early on it was audio only and so Laura and I sort of got used to doing this without video and then and now we can do it with video and there's been a couple of occasions for technical issues where we had to use Zoom or something else and so it's now dawning on us how much easier it is to do these with the video playing. But yeah, I think people are also, I think generally listening to these things in, you know, like on the airplane or in the car or or that sort of thing. So, I don't know that the video adds a whole lot of value to the podcasts themselves, but it's a heck of a lot easier to queue off of each other when when we do have the video running. I should say, we do try to make sure with every episode that we also include some other links, whether those are to people's research papers or their websites. We always try to make sure that there's other jumping off points connected to the podcast so that people can dig deeper into any particular podcast they're interested in.
Right. Laura, I'm going to start with you for this next question. You've been doing this for four years. What skills, what kind of expertise have you gained? How are you better at doing this now than you were four years ago?
Yeah. So, at first I was so nervous. The idea of having my voice broadcast was terrifying. So that really got in the way. Like it was hard to think of follow up questions. Sometimes I think I was so self-conscious I didn't even follow what the guest was saying very well. I'd be like, wait, what did they just say? But as I've gotten a lot more comfortable with it, that has completely gone away. And so, now it feels like a conversation. I'm listening for the guest's passion, their curiosity, trying to bring that out. Sometimes people mention in passing some key concept or interesting experience that they assume everyone knows about. And so it's kind of fun to just circle back and dig into that and get them to share that that little bit in a little more detail and pull out some of the exciting things they know that they are so, you know, ordinary to them that they don't even think of them as exciting anymore. So, it's been fun to kind of bring some of that to life in the conversations. I think that's something I've got a lot better at.
Mhm. So, I'm thinking back to when I was at a university, when I was giving lectures, when I was a professor at at Oakland University and I found that if there was a course and I was going to teach it several times, the first time I taught it, my whole attention was on me and what am I going to say and how am I going to present the material? And by the second or third time, I was comfortable enough so that I was looking at the class and seeing what they were how they were reacting and what they were doing. That feels like a phenomenological shift that that I made that that you're describing. And I wish there was an easy way to speed that up, but I'm not sure that there is. But it sounds like it's an important shift. So, you think that the podcasts you did later on were more powerful and more compelling because you're able to make that shift.
I think so. Yeah, I think I'm able to help make the guest more comfortable and help them, you know, bring out some bits that they might gloss over if if we didn't ask a few more questions.
Right. So, your attention is on the guest rather than on yourself.
Right, right. And then what I think Brian's really good at, I know you didn't ask me that, but um what what I love about Brian's approach is he often like real time makes these links between something they said and something else in the literature or some other concept. And so, he's really good at just, you know, bringing in this other perspective and asking people to comment on that. And that always creates really nice conversation too.
Well, since Laura's talking about me, I want to talk about something that she did. So, and I I said this actually, I think during the podcast, but it was one of our earlier podcasts with Shauna Perry and there was a moment where Shauna was starting to talk about an incident and I couldn't see Laura, but I could hear her and you could just, if you know anything about the critical decision method, you could just see her launch right into it because she was she was working her way through that second sweep and she was off to the races. And so, that's actually kind of a, you mentioned a phenomenological shift. I mean, that's something we've had to deal with because we're not interviewing, we're trying to have a conversation.
So, back to you, Brian, in terms of the kinds of skills and expertise, Laura's already teed you up a bit on this about what she likes, one of the things that she's admired. From your perspective, how have you become better at doing these podcasts after four years?
Yeah, I'd say one of the skills that I've picked up is not pursuing things. I mean, we try to keep these to under an hour. A lot of them are, you know, 45, 50 minutes long. And we've got to do our little intro and outro. And so, there's only so much time in these things. And and because it's not an interview where you've got your two hours, I mean, there's just so much that we could follow up with people on and but at the same time, we need to sort of move on to the next discussion. So, I found myself just continuously biting my tongue and and not making those connections and not pursuing those rabbit holes because, you know, we try to keep it going and keep things fairly efficient. And so, you mentioned the curiosity earlier, a big part of this podcast approach is just constraining your curiosity and not pursuing those topics that you'd like to hear more about. And sometimes you'll hear us say that. Oh, I I really want to ask about that, but we're going to move on.
Okay. So, Laura, you're you're impressed by the connections that Brian makes but maybe even Brian is impressed by the connections he doesn't make. Would there be any value in pre-interviewing people in order to to just get a sense of what the issues were to to make it easier for you to know where to focus your questions and and and where to sort of slip by quickly.
We do maybe even talking out of school now and giving everybody our secrets, but we do send the questions out ahead of time. So, folks at least know sort of or they have the opportunity to know roughly what we're going to ask about. And some folks seem to do quite a bit of preparation before they get to the podcast and some folks I think are just sort of going with the flow, but yeah, and and and I think again because we've somewhat kept up a familiar structure each time. If you've heard one before, you at least have a sense of of how it's going to run. So, I I think it's good, you know, much like we're always impressed by how experts can recall these very minute details of incidents they've been through. I think it's the same here with the folks we've interviewed, especially when we're walking through those early days and those epiphanies they had. I mean, they're still pretty clear in their head about their own career and how things kind of emerged. And so, that's always interesting to me just to see how people can go because Laura really likes to ask about, you know, those first publications people had and people came up with some pretty remarkable details about that process, which for them could have been 20, 30, 40 years ago.
Yeah. So, I want to add to that, so I think our first podcast with you, Gary, we did not send the questions ahead.
No, you did not. And I think after that, we always have. We we realized we had this idea that it would be fun to have this very spontaneous conversation and that if we sent them ahead, it would feel kind of stale and practiced, but I think we went overboard. And so, from then on we've always sent the questions ahead and we make it clear that, you know, we won't necessarily go in order and we'll follow the conversation, but here are the kind of topics we want to talk about. And we have had one or two people say I don't I don't want to talk about this. Like please take that question off. Or I've been working on this thing I'm really excited about. So, whether you ask me about it or not, I'm going to work it in there. Which is good. I mean, that's what we want, right? So, we don't pre-interview people, but we do have a little amount of interaction ahead of time just to give people a chance to really put their thoughts together before they're on the spot.
So, that's important. So, you you really have a preparation phase so that you can do some of the tailoring. It's not all the tailoring because even within the interview, it sounds like Brian, you're still biting your tongue and saying, I'm I'm not going to go down that direction because by now you have a sense, this is a direction that's going to chew up a lot of time and I I just have other issues and and questions that I think are going to be higher value.
Yeah, and it usually plays out pretty well. I mean, we typically don't get through all the questions that we go in with. It's those early ones where we're giving people a lot of opportunity to tell the origin story, tell us about the work that they're excited about. And yeah, I think for the most part, people like talking about their work and this, I mean, it is kind of unique in our field. We the work that people see is the work that has been prepared and you write a paper, you submit it and you see what the method was and what the researchers did and what the findings were and then you go to conferences and hear them talk about it, but we're hoping that this pulls the curtain back a bit and lets people see sort of what's been going on in a personal/professional career that folks have been building up. And so, I think that's to me even more interesting part of our podcast is that it's not just about the findings or the, you know, the decisions strategies that can help you make the right decisions in your life. It's really about the researchers and and the field of practice and the community of friends that we have and I think that that sort of personal view is something that people really appreciate and have commented on because, I mean, Laura mentioned Cedric, I mean Cedric lives in Singapore and he's never met any of us except on maybe a Zoom call or two and so, I think building that sense that you have a bit more insight into the professional personal lives that people have is I think pretty valuable.
It sounds like it is. And I'm still working through the implications of what Laura just said, that the very first interview with me sounds like it was so terrible that you decided you had to change dramatically what about approach you took. So, thanks a lot, Laura.
That is our origin story. Yes. Right. Okay, next question, I'm interested in what's been the impact of the podcast? How have they influenced the NDM movement? How have the podcast and the NDM association, the conferences, the webinars, the publications created a community and maybe a way to focus that is to contrast the NDM community now with the community when Brian, when you and Laura started the podcast and when you started the NDM association. What are you proud of that you've achieved?
That's a big question. So, I'll just offer my perspective on sort of what the podcast has accomplished and sort of led to. You know, there've been 16? Yeah, because we're getting ready to have the 17th. There've been 16 NDM conferences and, you know, that was sort of an every other year activity and things got planned by some group of people and if you heard about it, great, you'd be there. If you didn't, then you you just weren't there. And so, to me, when I left Klein Associates back in the 2007-ish year, I sort of felt a bit not all the way disconnected, but a bit disconnected and, you know, I'd sometimes hear about the conferences and sometimes hear about them too late. And so, to me as an individual with my own company but still connected to the community, I was starting to feel, yeah, a bit disengaged. And so, with the few conferences, the San Francisco conference, the DC Miter conference, started to feel reengaged, but also kind of realized that there might be other folks out there like me, right, who want to be in the community, who have contributions to make, but again, not having more of a formal way to gather the community of practice, maybe there were other folks who are feeling that way. And so, the podcasts for me were a way to think, how do we start to build community around a more formal information exchange platform and the podcast seem like a fun thing to do. But then as we move forward both in the podcasts and after, you know, the conference where we had the resiliency engineering co-hosted conference, I think a lot of us were also starting to feel like there's maybe more of an opportunity to get more formal about how we're we're organized. And so, the podcast was in some ways a seed for me personally to say, okay, this idea's got some legs, people are clearly wanting to be a bit more formal about how we think about NDM as an organization. And so, when we went to set up the association, it it felt like it felt natural, you know, even though it was just a series of somewhat disconnected events, but it felt like a natural progression between let's build the corporate history, if you will, with the podcasts, but then, you know, piggy back on that to have a more formal organization around the association. So, the past, you know, four years to me has felt like a yelling, a sort of coalescence of what's been there for decades, but we're just getting more organized and more formal about it. So, to me that's what the initial ideas around the podcasts have helped us to achieve is just everybody sort of getting on board with NDMs here to stay, but if it is to stay, we need to do a little bit more work to formalize it.
Okay, so I'm going to provide my own answer to my question, which is that I think without the podcasts and without the NDM association, there's a good chance the NDM movement would have started to dissipate at some point. And because of the work that the two of you have done and particularly your work with the NDM association, I'm much more hopeful and optimistic and enthusiastic that the NDM community and the NDM perspective is going to continue to expand and grow. So, I think that for me, that's the difference that that I've seen based on the work that you've done.
Good, mission accomplished. At least in my mind it is.
Yeah. No, I agree and I just want to acknowledge that Brian has done the lion share of that work of thinking it through and setting it up and engaging folks. So, yeah, I know I keep getting grouped there and I am a helper, but Brian's really driving it.
Laura, you still have to answer the original question though.
Okay, so I will say that I love having the ability to suggest the podcast to friends and colleagues who are curious about what we do. You know, they might not be people who are going to go buy sources of power or read a journal article, but so it's a really low effort introduction to NDM. Sometimes, I'll even suggest a specific podcast if they're a healthcare person. I'll say, oh, we did this great interview with Shauna Perry and a surprising number of people come back to me and say they checked out the podcast and I think it's a really good outreach mechanism. So, Brian was focusing on how we've kind of formalized and re-energized, which is true, but I think we've not just building up what we are, but looking outward is a big part of this focus. And so the other thing I thought about here is, I think these podcasts sometimes highlight connections and links to other traditions and disciplines or Brian sometimes describes them as parallel efforts. And so, I think that is enriching the conversation in some important ways. And I'll even give you a couple examples. So, we've spoken to two ethnographers recently, Vann Tan and Christian Madsberg, who do really in-depth observations over long periods of time, like true ethnographers. And I think about in the work I do, I'm always having this pressure to do things quickly. So, you know, 20 years ago we almost always did two hour interviews. Now we're lucky if we get an hour with people, sometimes they're saying, can you do it in 30 minutes, like we're so busy. And then, as soon as we've got data, people want a product or implications very quickly. So the time to really sit with the data and look at it and think about it and go back and ask some follow-up questions, I feel like there's so much pressure to shrink that up. And so, for me it's been great to talk to these people that are doing true ethnography and just remind myself how powerful it is to take time and explore these little loose ends that maybe aren't loose ends, maybe are really important insights and really pushing for that in spite of the pressure in the other direction. So, that has felt for me like a good energizing kind of conversation. And then we also have been talking to practitioners. So, we talked with Ron Bazian, who works in the petrochemical industry, who actually wrote a book. So, he got interested in NDM, read about the RPD model and it really, it sounds like transformed the way he thought about his work and the way he trains folks in the petrochemical industry. When we talked to Shauna Perry, the emergency department physician, she talked about how this perspective influences her work in the ED, how she mentors residents and even how she talks to the organization about safety and efficiency issues. So, I think these conversations are just bringing voices forward that aren't always in the journal articles or at the academic meetings, but are really important voices.
It sounds like it. What's running through my mind right now is the way you make a targeted use of specific podcasts, that you have such fluency in on all of the the 50 podcasts you've done that you can say you should listen to this one with Ron Bozian or this one with Shauna Perry or this one with Jan Martin. Whatever the case, you can pull up an appropriate podcast and that sort of pulls the person into the podcast series and into the NDM movement. And so, that's an important power that you have a way that you're able to use the podcasts. Am I accurate on that?
Absolutely. And it's I feel like it's a more flexible and powerful tool than things we've written.
Mhm. So, what about people who aren't you, who haven't done 50 podcasts? Is there any way for your listeners to be able to make a targeted use of specific podcasts?
I don't know. You know, I was as we were getting ready for this, I was looking at the list of podcasts on the NDMA website. They're all listed there with a sentence or two highlight. So, you really can scroll through there and see what's interesting to you. But I did wonder is there, you know, is there another way to do this? I don't know, but I just really today started thinking about that.
Now I'm thinking about it and realizing we probably could do more to organize. So, right now they're sort of in the order that we did them. But there are some clusters, right? We've talked to a number of folks in healthcare and there's probably, you know, a military cluster or something like that. So, there are probably some ways we can help people find their ways to them. We are working on and and will probably after the next conference in the two years between the conferences, do more to sort of share clips and share insights from the podcasts themselves so that again, those can sort of find their way to people and people can find their ways to them. And, you know, we're always thinking more about who we're going to have on the podcast next. And I I agree with Laura that having those NDM-oriented practitioners has been really insightful because it's one thing to listen to us talk about the research, but to hear people who have come to NDM because they see that there's potentially something useful there and get as far as a Ron or a Shauna and bringing it into the work that they do and and the way that they do their work, I think those are the stories that are going to compel others in even domains we haven't touched yet to start to get involved. I know I've been approached by a number of people also who either heard the podcast or saw the website from domains that NDM hasn't really touched before and so, I do think that the podcasts and particularly if we start to package them in ways that speak more to outside audiences can be a way to spread using a different kind of tool, spread the word.
And Brian, you talked about maybe taking the podcasts you've done and cluster them to make it easier for people to find one that's relevant. And I would suggest that it'd be a flexible cluster because an interview might be about a domain, but also about a method, it also might be about a certain kinds of interventions. So, and instead of deciding, do I want it to be A or B? It could be all of those things.
Right, and some of the people, frankly, they're just going to have to be clusters of one because I'm not sure there's a cluster that's appropriate for Dave or or Robert Hoffman. So, they just have to be clusters of one.
Yeah. And there've ever been cases of people self-nominating and saying why don't you do a podcast with me?
Not yet. Why not? Oh, that's a great question. We should use this opportunity to say if you believe that you are appropriate for the NDM podcast, let us know. So, let me answer that somewhat seriously and say that I think this sort of thing is unusual for people in our community to be involved in, right? And this gets back to the point we made earlier about some people saying, I just don't think I could do that, right? So, our community, especially the the research side of the community, maybe, and well, and the practitioners too, frankly, they may deliver papers, they may have posters, but the idea of sort of talking about their work and themselves, I think there's only, you know, we can count them on one hand, the people in our 50 who have done that sort of thing before, right? I mean, you and Dave and Leah maybe. There's just not a bunch of people out there who are used to talking about themselves and their careers and their research in the way that we do on this podcast. And so, that may be one reason people don't self-nominate is just because this sort of thing is just not something that people in our community generally do.
It's not natural. It's not natural. Exactly. On naturalistic decision making. So, my last question is about where you're going next. The first four years have been really exciting and really productive. Do you have specific plans or you're just going to be opportunistic, which gives you flexibility and keeps the engagement high so that you're you're not sort of scripting it, but do you have any plans for the years ahead?
I think we have ideas that hopefully will turn into plans. I am particularly interested in this idea of the parallel communities and building those bridges with people in similar lines of work because I think there's huge value in both directions. You know, Laura mentioned Christian who was also a keynote at our last conference and what I was struck by from his perspective was how much he appreciated the structure that cognitive task analysis brings to the work, which he thought ethnographers could use more of. So, I do think there's a tremendous value in finding those other communities and and building those bridges. Even, I mean, frankly, even sort of within our own broader community, I I thought our interview with David Veldon was was one of our most interesting because here's a person, I playfully refer to him and and Richard Clark and others as sort of West Coast CDA just because they're they're all out of USC. But, you know, that's a group who does cognitive task analysis and I think it's sort of a version or a brand of cognitive task analysis. But even that felt to me like kind of a bridge building exercise because it's there's not been a whole lot of crossover between folks who do more clients CTA and and folks who do Clark CTA. So, there's even some other bridges we can build I think even with communities that are very very close to us. I think the idea of finding more folks who have found us and hearing their stories is particularly important because oftentimes what I found is that people who find NDM, you know, they're going to hear about NDM, they're going to try NDM models, they're going to try to understand them, they're going to try cognitive task analysis, but they still may be looking for for what else, right? So, what do we do with this sort of thing? And I've had a number of those conversations over the past couple years with people who get it, they understand the descriptions, they get the value of the models, but they're looking for what does this mean for me and my workplace and how do I get it in here? And so, those kinds of conversations with people who have been successful in doing it, I think will be particularly important moving forward.
So, that's another function of of the podcast particularly is building bridges to other communities and creating this kind of professional networking. Okay. Laura, what about you? What are your thoughts about the interviews ahead, the podcasts ahead?
Yeah, so much much the same. Brian and I have talked about this. I also just find that I go to I was at a meeting at NASA recently and met, you know, some fascinating people that I'd love to talk to in a podcast or, you know, we'll read a book and think, oh, this is someone we should connect with. So, it does seem like there are just always going to be lots of interesting people to talk to.
Well, you folks have been leaders of the NDM community by the efforts you've put in and by your accomplishments and certainly these podcasts are a leading edge for making NDM available and accessible to the wider community around the world. So, I really appreciate all the work that you've done and thank you very much for this opportunity to talk to you about it.
Thanks for taking the time. Thanks for being our only repeat guest on the NDM podcast. That is that is rare air that you're in now. But yeah, Gary, I I think it means a lot to me to have you here and to realize that you're seeing value and and you've seen value out of this effort. The podcast will continue, but we have other work to do to continue to grow the association and of course, the conferences will still continue to be the cornerstone of NDM activity. So, we're working hard to get ready for the next one and already have sites on the following. So, podcasts I think are hopefully going to be a a future cornerstone as well.
So, we should say the next meeting is July 1st to 5th in Auckland, New Zealand. Hope you can join.
Either in person or virtually. Yeah, the the virtual aspects of being able to do work I think has been a huge boon and and we're taking advantage of that in a number of ways podcasts and virtual presentations. So, look into the next conference. And on that note, thank you so much for joining us for this NDM podcast. I'm Brian Moon.
