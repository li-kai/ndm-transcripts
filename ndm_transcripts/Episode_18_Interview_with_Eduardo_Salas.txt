**Speaker 1:** The Naturalistic Decision Making Podcast with Brian Moon and Laura Millatello. This podcast series brings you interviews with leading NDM researchers who study and support people who make decisions under stress.

**Speaker 1:** Welcome to the Naturalistic Decision Making podcast. This is Laura Millatello from Applied Decision Science.

**Speaker 2:** And I'm Brian Moon from Paragian Technologies.

**Speaker 1:** Today we welcome Eduardo Salas. Eduardo is the Alan R. and Gladis M. Klein Professor and chair of the Department of Psychological Sciences at Rice University. He is a prolific author and an active consultant. He's published over 600 articles and chapters and his work has been cited over 100,000 times. That's that's a big number. Um, he has uh he's consulted on a wide range of domains including healthcare, manufacturing, oil and gas, and aviation and aerospace. He is a past president of the Society for Industrial Organizational Psychology and the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, and he's also a fellow in numerous other scientific societies. Dr. Salas has received two lifetime achievement awards, one from the American Psychological Association and another from the Society for Human Resources Management. He is co-author of the recently published book Teams That Work, the Seven Drivers of Team Effectiveness. Welcome Eduardo, and thank you for joining us today.

**Speaker 3:** Thank you Laura and Brian. Uh, glad to be here.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, we're really happy to get a chance to speak with you. And so I wanted to begin at the very beginning, and I'm wondering if you can remember the very first paper you ever published.

**Speaker 3:** The, uh, publication was with my advisor, um, and at that time was the first time we began to talk about team training and team development, uh, interventions.

**Speaker 1:** I see, I see. So, do you remember was that um based on a study you did or?

**Speaker 3:** No, so my my interest in teams and teamwork uh derived from a class I took in grad school with, uh, again my advisor at that time uh Al Klickman. He was a seminar on teams and he was, this is now in the mid 80s and he was about to get a grant uh on teams. So in class, uh I got interested in in the in the topic and we connected and then we began to write together and and then when I joined the Navy, uh, we began to, uh, to collaborate.

**Speaker 1:** So,

**Speaker 3:** We continue to collaborate.

**Speaker 1:** I see. And so that early that early work on teams when you first started writing and thinking about it, were you thinking about military teams there or other kinds of teams or?

**Speaker 3:** Yes, it was a military because the proposal that he was writing and and what he was talking in class was all about the the military. And since I had done a little work before I joined Old Dominion, uh on in the I did some work in the military. Um, so that's how we connected.

**Speaker 1:** I see. Um, and so uh, what were you thinking about then that early in your career about teams and and and team training?

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, so, uh actually, you know, when I was done in 84, I joined the Navy, uh, as a research psychologist, civil servant. And I was hired to develop a team training team performance laboratory. So I did two things. I had two goals. The first was to try to understand the kind of teams that I was dealing with. So I spent uh, three, six months, I remember traveling to uh, US Navy, um, uh, bases and trying to look at submarine teams, uh, different types of combat teams. So I did that. But the other thing, the other stream that I had going was at that time, I had learned about meta analysis. And so and as you know meta analysis is a quantitative integration of number studies. So I wanted to see what was out there? What what what was the state of the science? So I started uh with uh Al Klickman, Sarah Dickinson and other colleagues. Uh we started a huge meta analysis trying to understand again, uh the the state of the science. So those were the two things that I was thinking about at away at the beginning, you know, trying to understand the real teams that I was dealing with and try to understand the science where where were we? What was the uh the the the knowledge that we had at that time.

**Speaker 1:** I see. I see. And, uh, so I I have, um, a sense that many, uh, industrial organizational academic departments, um, really emphasize surveys as as a a primary method, but you were you were going out and doing naturalistic observations. Um, was that, uh, counter culture to the department there at Old Dominion or or um were other folks doing that kind of thing?

**Speaker 3:** No, well, it's true. So, um, you know, yeah, industrial organizational psychologists began to do surveys, self-reported, um, uh, type of, uh, instruments. But when I got to the Navy, um, and and I began to do this, you know, exploratory things with the real teams and the science. I quickly got to the conclusion that self-report was not going to get us too far. And so we also, uh, decided, uh, you know, a number of a number of us that we needed to do observations. We need to look at real teams doing real things. Um, so experts, that's what we we wanted to do. And, uh, some of the funding that I got, uh, came from the Office of Naval Research, and ONR, uh, at that time was a little quote-unquote tired of funding industrial organizational psychologists to do surveys because in the 70s and early 80s, that's all they were doing. So when I got there, they're meaning the Navy, um, they basically said, why don't you look at experts on real teams? And so we embarked in in in that, uh, in that path of looking, uh, and observing real teams doing real things. In this case where where simulations, right? So we but but that at least this was, uh, experts.

**Speaker 1:** Ah, so they were you had some kind of simulator or simulated environment?

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, I at that time the Navy had, uh, big, uh, buildings, they they they called team trainers as a matter of fact. So at that time in Norfolk, in San Diego, in, uh, Connecticut, uh, the the naval bases have these huge rooms, uh, that that essentially mimic, uh, ships and and the combat information centers, for example, that they had. So, um, that where the since we observed the teams, we interviewed the experts. Uh, that's what we collected the data, uh, at the beginning.

**Speaker 1:** I see. I see. So, so it sounds like just kind of the needs of the topics you were studying were kind of what pushed you into this more observational approach. Um, the phenomenon you wanted to understand you just felt like you couldn't really learn enough relying only on surveys.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, and then there was another big, um, uh, event that, uh, essentially forced us to study experts. Uh, which also led me to get into the E and NDM field. So in when the USNS Vincent shut down the Iranian Airbus by mistake, to make a long story short, uh, Congress allocated, um, a lot of money to the Office of Naval Research to study teams under stress, the Patmos program that some of you might most of you might be familiar with.

**Speaker 1:** Sure.

**Speaker 3:** And when we got the money, um, to do this, there was a, um, a strict requirement that we would have to look at experts and and look at again, expert doing real things. So by the late 80s, even though we were still we were doing that and, um, we were doing that. When we got this big, um, uh, the infusion of money uh to do more and better things, the requirement came to us as that you must study, uh, experts.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, so sorry.

**Speaker 3:** Um,

**Speaker 1:** Okay, and so it's so, um, at that at that time, it seems like uh, psychologists were just kind of figuring out, um, how to adapt methods from sociology and other domains to do, uh, observations and and if we're going to do interviews, what kind of questions to ask and how to do that? So you were part of that group that was really, um, looking around for how to how to extend methods from other disciplines, uh, to study expertise.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, so, um, we needed one of the first things we we noticed once we got the the urgent orders if you will to to do this is that, um, the industrial organizational psychology theories and methods was not enough. And so we needed to explore other things. So yeah, we went to human factors approaches, anthropological approaches, uh, sociologists, we were looking for, uh, more robust and rich methods, uh, of observation. Um, and we also were looking for uh, new theoretical perspectives, you know, from cognitive psychology, cognitive science, uh, mathematical also, uh, you know, we were interested in in whether we can model, uh, team performance and learn from it. So we took a, um, a multi-disciplinary approach, uh, and tried to engage, uh, scientists that had, um, they were had a different uh lens to what we were looking at.

**Speaker 1:** Interesting. So, so it it sounds as if, um, your your career very early on, you you got interested in these naturalistic, um, methods even before they had a name, um, but it wasn't it doesn't sound like there was a a deliberate turn that you were you were, um, deeply, uh, entrenched in in in more traditional IO methods and then made a turn. It sounds like this just kind of happened organically for you.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, it happened and then of course, we uh, along the way as we were doing all this, you know, uh, we met Gary Klein, uh, Danielle Sirfaty, we met, uh, uh, you know, um, Mark Cohen and and others who uh, Robert Hoffman, uh, who were, you know, beginning to think about, you know, kind of like the NDM uh, uh movement, I would call it at that time. And and and and so we we got attached to that and we said this is where we need this is where we we can maybe get help, where we can, um, uh, learn and and and and that's how we we got into, uh, NDM.

**Speaker 2:** So Eduardo, that that first NDM meeting was in Dayton uh, in 89, I believe. And you were there as well? Uh, can can you tell us kind of what you remember about that meeting?

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, I tell you that uh what I remember was there was no TV and no phones in the room.

**Speaker 3:** And that one we said, uh, I remember saying this, you know, uh, I think this organization needs a little money. So we we began to program our money. There's no phones and TVs on the on the rooms. Um, so, you know, you know, kidding aside, um, well, it it it it that was to me an eye opening experience because again, uh, the names I just gave you, Gary, Robert, uh, we met and and what we learned and uh, Julie Zora was there too from NASA, um, it essentially what we learned there with uh Jen Kanower was my partner. Uh, we said this is this is the the the area, this is the the scientists that are going to help us. And so from now on, you know, until I left the Navy, we supported the NDM conference and and then of course we at that time we gave, um, uh, resources to a number of uh, scientists there to uh, to study things to help us. So it it was a great conference other than no phone and no TV.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, so I think they hosted it in a monastery.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah. Funny. It was it was fun. I mean, I think all the NDM's uh that, you know, I haven't been to uh maybe in a couple of years in a few years, but uh they were all always fun.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah. Yeah. They are fun meetings. Um, so when you reflect back on your career from where you sit now, I want to wonder is there one project that really stands out for you as as particularly fulfilling?

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, it was the Patmos uh, um, you know, the tactical decision making under stress program that eventually we published a book in 1998. Um, you know, teams under stress, um, that project was unbelievable. First of all, we had a lot of money. Um, and when you have money, then you can, uh, you know, seek help and expertise and you can try different things. But that project had everything, you know, had we developed theory, we developed methods, we collected lots of data in in simulations, laboratories and in in real environments, um, we we provided, um, a number of, um, guidance, guidelines, principles to the Navy. Um, somebody long time ago from the Navy actually told told me once that that the beauty of Patmos was that it changed how the Navy did training. So so we, you know, that project was very enriching, uh, very rewarding. I learned a lot. We all learned a lot, uh, learned how to defend money because we were we had so much money that a lot of people said, how come uh, but you psychologist have this money and I don't have gasoline for my ship. I mean literally some of the military people were were upset that we had all these resources. So that project was uh, unbelievable uh, in in in my career. You know, I still remember uh, what I do today and how I approach, um, consulting and observing teams came from there. So that project started in 88, 89 and lasted until 98 somewhere around there.

**Speaker 1:** So you said it really changed the way the army did training.

**Speaker 3:** The Navy.

**Speaker 1:** The Navy, sorry. The way the Navy did training. Can you um give us an example of of what what kind of changes you you saw this, um,

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, so, um, you know, one of the things that we we we were doing, especially Jan Kanower was going to Naval training facilities and giving talks about what we were doing and what we were finding. So what we gave them, these are now instructors, um, heads of, uh, of training. We gave them a different way to think about learning and training and simulation and in how to think about scenario based training, where scenario is the curriculum. And not just put people in a simulation for the sake of of that, so that so that the the simulation have to be, um, have to be carefully crafted so that uh, behaviors and cognitions could be observed, assessed. So we that's what we did. We we we told them I guess I guess, um, how to think about learning and and training and simulation and team training. And I think that's an, you know, till today an enduring, um, legacy, uh, we most of the feedback that we got was because of you guys, quote unquote, um, we did we change our approach. So I I cannot tell you, I cannot quantify this. I cannot tell you where to go to find all the changes we made because one of the things that I usually say is that our biggest product in in, you know, on on the Patmus program was that we change people's mind. And so we did this essentially one one uh, training side at a time. So we traveled a lot through all the naval bases doing lectures and helping instructors. So, so I think, you know, again, the the the person that told me that was an ex captain when when he retired and I met him at a conference and he said, you know, you guys changed the way the Navy did training. That was very rewarding to hear that.

**Speaker 1:** Sure, yeah. Yeah, so is there uh a contrasting mindset you can think of the way folks were thinking about it that that the Patmos program really shifted.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, so, you know, training, um, in the Navy at that time was, uh, let's put them uh, the people in the simulators or simulations. And, um, you know, let let's see how they do, um, and if they if they're doing well, we're going to put them put them down so they can learn, uh, you know, that that this is not easy. I mean, it was it was a very in my view archaic way of doing learning. And so we we provided theory, we provided structure, we provided a methodology. Again, this scenario based training approach, event based approach to training. We provided tools and and and and I think that, you know, the way simulation actually beyond the military especially now in healthcare, you know, has shifted to to be something more systematic, more essentially gone to basics, more thinking about what are the learning objectives, what are the learning outcomes. Given the learning outcomes, what triggers we need to have in the simulation that elicit the kind of behaviors that we want. Uh, you know, and on the basis of that, um, what is it that we need to assess, how we need to assess the observations, and so forth. And then how do we debrief? And so that cycle is I think what we created, um, and and still I guess it's used today.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, so I can imagine an organization like the Navy with such a long history had probably lots of legacy practices, like this is how we've always trained, this is what we've always done. And you were kind of helping them, uh, just think about it in a more mindful way.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, we provided a uh, the structure and and and we provided data. But the other, you know, to me, another piece of why I love, um, Patmos is we were, uh, we again, Jen Cano Bauer, John Hall, uh, Don Duyer, I mean I can give you a bunch of names. We were, um, so motivated to help, I think that that that spirit, that, uh, attitude got, um, transmitted, I guess, or was recognized by the by the fleets that we were trying to help, that we were not this uh, Iwer Twer PhD psychologists. And that opened a lot of doors and and people wanted to listen to us as opposed to say, oh, here comes another PhD that's going to tell us all this stuff. So I I I in reflecting back over the years, when all of all of the Navy PIs, you know, again, Jan Can Bauer, John Hall and another, we we talked about this, our motivation, our energy to try to do to have impact. I think was a big driver of why people listened to us at least opened the door so uh so that they can listen to what we had to offer. Um, and eventually they, they change, they they they believed us, they trusted us and they did things differently.

**Speaker 1:** Wow, that sounds like a really exciting time. It must have been very cool to be right at the heart of all that.

**Speaker 3:** Oh, my 15 years in the Navy, you know, I worked there from 84 to 99 and then I became an academic. Those 15 years were unbelievable like I said, very rewarding, you know, we we did all kinds of things, we try all kinds of things. We were young and bold and wanted to have impact. Um, all of the all of us wanted to have impact. You know, I never wanted to be an academic but uh, and eventually in those years in the Navy, we published so much that, you know, the transition to academia was easy. But those 15 years there were, uh, you know, wow, I I I just don't, uh, I I I have no words to describe other than how enriching and, you know, uh, fulfilling, uh, we learned a lot, we we made mistakes, we laughed, we cried. I mean everything, it was just unreal. Unreal.

**Speaker 2:** So Eduardo, you shared that interesting anecdote about the, um, the commanders wondering why you were getting money and they didn't have gas. I wonder if there were other times when you could remember some pushback or where you kind of struggled to get uh traction.

**Speaker 3:** I tell you, you know, at that time it was a it was a pain in the butt but uh, the Patmos program had a an advisory board and we were uh, so so yeah, it had an advisory board that we would meet every six months. So every real, literally every six months we had a review of our progress and so forth. Uh, Bill Hall was the chair and the and the board was composed of somebody from the army, somebody from the Air Force and a number of people in uniform. A a couple of captains, and so forth. We were drilled every six months about stuff that we were doing and and and so uh, essentially every six months, we had to defend our program. At that time it was a pain, it was uh frustrating, uh, but in looking back, I think if it wasn't for that uh board that made us, um, made us uh ground all our stuff in in in impact and in real in things that would matter to the Navy. I don't think it it would have, um, would have, uh, would have worked. So that board, uh, was murdered to us. I mean it was just incredible. But we we survived all of them, you know, we we we kept going, we kept doing things and we took their advice and we just kept going. And, uh, yeah, there was a a number of push pushbacks that we had to go and brief uh different uh commanders, uh, who were in a sense complaining that, you know, this program had like 20 million dollars and and, uh, they couldn't get uh gas to for their ships. Uh at that time there was the economy wasn't like great, I think. But anyway, so so yeah, we had a lot of pushback. As in now, you know, 20 years later. I wouldn't call it pushback. I would call it, you know, um, benevolent guidance.

**Speaker 1:** Did you say benevolent guidance?

**Speaker 3:** Yeah. Something, you know, maybe maybe not benevolent but they I mean they were they were harsh. But um, but it it made us think, it made us always be on our toes and always try to remember our objective, the aims and who we were trying to help and so forth.

**Speaker 2:** Can you talk a little bit about uh sort of credibility? I mean it sounds like you especially dealing with folks in uniform having served, did that provide you any credibility? You say again uh compared to some of your other partners?

**Speaker 3:** Well, um, I tell you how we gained credibility to them. So, uh, when we got uh the money, ONR had a had a program it was called scientist at sea. And so what we did was, uh, for example, Jan Cannobauer deployed for three weeks. She was on board a ship for three weeks. So she was sweating and, uh, getting dirty like uh, all the sailors. So when she came back, uh, she could talk uh, about, um, uh, how is it to, uh, be, uh, work on on a ship. I was supposed to do the same thing, but mine got canceled and so most of us got credibility because we got dirty with them. We, uh, we we had, you know, uh, been on their ships, on their on their, uh, training facilities. And so that helped tremendously. Um, uh, so what one of the things that we did, uh, while I was there, every time we got a new project, around team training, whether it was, uh, air, surface, subsurface, we try to, um, uh, deploy or go on a ship or go and spend some time, uh, where they were training and and and look at the the facilities and those kind of things. So we gain, we gain tremendous credibility. Uh, especially Jan when she could say, you know, I've been there. Uh, and I sweated with all of you. And she had the lingo and she got the, um, uh, uh, all the experience of three weeks being deployed. So that helped us and and I learned that. So now, when I do some consulting or what, I'm going to do some research, the first thing I want to do is immerse myself in the context. You know, just observe, walk around, see what they're doing. And and that that helps long term.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, absolutely. I've I I've had similar experiences and in some domains it's really, really hard to be able to do. Um, but but when you can do it, it's super helpful.

**Speaker 3:** So in the healthcare stuff that I do now, for example, I, you know, I've been in ORs for hours, I've been in NCUs for hours, um, observe and, you know, uh, and and try to get a sense of what are these experts doing? That's the any thing I learned at the Akran, uh, meeting, the first meeting of NDM, it was, you know, it's about experts. It is about real people doing real things. Um, and and that has stuck with me, you know, uh, all this time.

**Speaker 1:** So I want to fast forward to to today and I'm wondering what are uh, what's the most exciting thing that you're working on right now?

**Speaker 3:** There are two, uh, two things. Um, one is health care and as you may or may not know, there's an obsession with teamwork in healthcare because of the medical errors. And so, um, about 75% of the things I do is health care. Either I go and give lots of talks about the science of of teamwork and the science of team training, or, um, I do research there. So health care is, you know, um, it it's they they need all all these uh, knowledge that we have around teams and team training. So I I also helped, uh, there's a medical team training program called Team Steps. Uh, all one word with double P. Um, if you Google that, you'll you'll you'll be able to uh, find a site, uh, where you can download a medical team training program, which is about eight hours of, uh, you know, curriculum and tapes and videos and all kind of things. And I was I I was one of the scientists who helped design that and, you know, I'm happy and proud to say that, uh, about 70% of the US hospitals use it. You you can download it free by the way, and and and it's, uh, it it comes in word, so you can change adapted. It's an incredible resource. And so, um, that has given me some credibility and all my experience. So the exciting thing is when I go to a hospital and a CEO or a chief medical officer ask me a question, like, you know, I don't know, make this up a little bit, you know, what should we do? And I tell them, well, I think you should turn to the left. And I leave and then three weeks later, I get a call and says, you know, you told us to turn to the left, we did it and we're doing good. That that can impact. that's uh, that's incredible. So health care is one that is interesting to me because they they're listening, especially now with COVID-19, my God, they they they need help these teams, this is there's a like we call like they are, you know, these heroes are in the front line, they're, uh, helping others. So that one. And the second, so that that kind of one bucket. The other bucket is although I'm doing a little less now, but uh eight, nine years of uh five, six, seven years ago I was doing a lot is NASA. So, um, you know, if we go to Mars in 2035, 36 somewhere around there, we're going to send a team and so team cohesion is uh and teamwork, uh, issues are uh, paramount, uh, to the success of, um, of the mission. So, NASA has a branch uh now devoted to team performance, to team cohesion. And I've done some work uh around team training, around try to understand team cohesion, um, NASA has a mockup at Johnson Space Center of what a shuttle capsule might look like and we're running participants, astronaut like participants through there. So that's another one very rewarding because, um, what you find and what you say, it matters. And and so those are the two things that now, uh, I'm I'm I'm doing, uh, but a lot more in healthcare. As a matter of fact, I'll tell you this morning at 7:00 o'clock, I gave a lecture, a virtual lecture to 100 plus surgeons of Texas Children Hospital on teamwork. Uh, I'm the ground round. And I do a lot of those. Those those two things are uh, you know, exciting. And, uh, as you noted in the in in the intro in the bio, uh, my book just came out yesterday, uh, on all this science that we have, uh, and that's exciting to see how how see how that goes, but the book was published uh, it's online now that's another exciting thing. We're doing with my partner Scott Hanabow, who's the lead author. Uh, we've been doing a lot a lot of talks and podcast like like this and and the like. So that's, that's what, um, keeps me young these days.

**Speaker 1:** Very nice. So I wondered if you have any observations about differences between military teams and healthcare teams?

**Speaker 3:** None. None. So the way the way I, uh, I approach this is, you know, it's about task interdependence. So if the team has high task interdependence or some degree of task interdependence, the competencies and what we know from the military and what we know from aviation and what we know from nuclear power, uh, or anything else, generalizes. You know, and and we are very, uh, cautious about over generalizing, but. So we say, you know, if if there is high interdependence and you need the expertise from somebody else to execute a task, then, um, things can go from from healthcare to the military, to the military, to aviation and so forth. And as a matter of fact, uh, I would tell you, the most of what's in in the book, uh, we just wrote, most of the most of the science is from military and very much, uh, appreciated, uh, by healthcare.

**Speaker 1:** Interesting, interesting. So your new book, um, which I did see on Amazon just this morning, um, it, uh, it it it really summarizes some of the, um, important and and somewhat universal themes that you've observed over your career.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, it it what it does is we we have a heuristic there. Um, we call it the seven Cs of teamwork, but again, it's just a heuristic not a theory. It's it's a way to organize the body of knowledge, uh, that we have. And in that book, uh, we invoke like 30, 35 uh, meta analysis. So there's a wealth of information on teams and what matters. And so that's what we have done in in in in that book. It's it's a very practical book. It's not a, if you want to learn theories of of team dynamics, that's not the book. This is a book, uh, for leaders, for practitioners and and we, uh, illustrate the science behind the guidance that we provided in in in that book. Um, but most of it if if if the citations are either from the military or work that was funded by the military.

**Speaker 1:** So can you think of one or two insights about teams that you think most organizations don't realize or under appreciate?

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, the number one killer of teamwork is the lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities, which is unbelievable to me. So teams, again, the number one killer of teamwork across industries, across tasks, across, um, types of teams is when people don't know what they're supposed to do and with whom. Lack of clarity, um, it it's it's one insight. A second insight is, you know, it's related to share mental models and things we did with the NDM, which is organizations and leaders believe that the more communication the better. And we have learned that more is not necessarily better. Better is better. And so, you know, the best ORs I've been, the best military teams I see are quiet. Because they have a shared understanding of what they need to do, they anticipate their needs, they pass information without teamish requesting it. And so this is the whole idea of share mental models that came from the NDM framework, uh, gets people in gets this aha. And so those two things are I you know, I can tell you 10 other things, but those are the incredible uh, awakening in organization when they say role clarity. And and they all say, of course, yes, I remember. Yeah, because I didn't know what I was supposed to do. My boss told told us that we were a team, but I didn't know why I was here. So, those are two, uh, two kind of, uh, insights.

**Speaker 2:** So you mentioned this morning you uh, gave a lecture Eduardo, it was it was at the students?

**Speaker 3:** It was to surgeons. Uh surgeons, yeah.

**Speaker 2:** Um, but but you're also doing teaching now, is that correct?

**Speaker 3:** No, I'm not chair, um, this year I'm not teaching because I'm chair of the department. So, I got it. What I, but I do have doctoral students, so while I'm not not do formal training, I do a lot of informal training.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, right. That's actually where I wanted to go with the question, which is to say, mentoring uh younger folks coming up in their careers, what kinds of advice are you giving them? Uh, now that we do have such a robust science of teams. Um, what kind of technic what kind of technical advice you're giving them, but also just sort of career advice?

**Speaker 3:** Well, um, uh, you know, I've placed, uh, maybe five, six doctoral students in either schools of medicine or at hospitals. If I can graduate, uh, five more in the next few months, they will all be placed in healthcare. It's amazing. Uh, so what I tell them is, you know, you have to follow your passion. Uh, one, two is, uh, even though you're an academic, uh, at least I hope they get this for me, which is, um, have impact. You can write all the articles in the world and the most prestigious journals, but if nobody reads them and nobody can extract practical implications from it, uh, that is that what I do. So I tell them, you know, follow your passion, have impact, um, and, uh, you know, be essentially a scientist practitioner, um, somebody that uses the science, uh, to inform practice and the practice informs science. So those are the kind of three, two, three things and, um, and then they go out and, you know, have a couple of John Hopkins, VCU, a number of places they're doing well.

**Speaker 1:** So I know you have mentored many people and influenced folks in the NDM community and and well beyond that. I'm wondering who are some of the people who have influenced you or inspired uh inspired you over the course of your career?

**Speaker 3:** Wow. Well, I have to tell you, I've been a lucky fellow. Um, throughout my career, I've been surrounded by intelligent, motivated, talented, inspirational, um, group of colleagues. So, Jen Cannobauer was one, no question about it. Uh, Scott Hanabow, who I worked with, he's another one. John Matthew, who's a another. So Scott Hanabow and John Matthew uh we went to grad school together. We are old Dominion. Um, I have to say, uh, if not, he he won't send me a Christmas card, Gary Klein. So where he where he listens to this, you know, he'll be happy and he continue to send me Christmas cards. Um, Uh, yeah, the, you know, from the NDM, uh, movement, uh, Mark Cohen, uh, Danielle Sirfaty, um, you know, all of those gave me a little bit to to reflect on and to do things. Um, and again, I've been fortunate because, uh, I've been surrounded by a lot of good people, uh, you know, and and, um, if you look at my publication record even though I have a lot, I mean, very few that I'm the lead author. I collaborate with a lot of people who have great ideas, very creative, very talented, very motivated, and who had to some degree the same passion that I have about having impact. So, but but those are the the names, um, that come to mind.

**Speaker 1:** It makes sense that a teams researcher would really value collaboration, so.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah. A nice fit.

**Speaker 3:** Did I mention did I mention Gary Klein?

**Speaker 1:** You did. Okay.

**Speaker 3:** Uh, so next, uh, will you tell us one thing about you that you think the audience probably doesn't know?

**Speaker 3:** One thing about me that the audience doesn't know? Well, uh, obviously my this accent is not from Texas. Um, I'm from Lima, Peru. Uh, I've been here 45 years in this country. Um, one thing they don't know about me. Well, uh, when I came to this country 45 years ago, I I ended up in Nebraska. So, two things happened. I learned football in Nebraska. So I'm a Huker fan. And two, this is probably not exactly what you were asking but the reason I became a US citizen long time ago and stay in this country. I fell in love with the Midwest, with the Midwest people. So maybe people don't know about that. that that that uh, wow, this is now the 70s, right? Uh, so, uh, it was unbelievable. Uh, I I I spent time in a town called Carney, Nebraska. Which is about a couple of hours from Lincoln and Omaha. And that's what I, this is how I left Lima Peru and came to Cor Nebraska and then fell in love with the US and here I am.

**Speaker 2:** All right, so so I've got a I've got a follow on question to that, uh, which is to say, uh, to put these two parts of of this podcast together. At one point you said you never wanted to be an academic, uh, and and and so now you're um taking us back to to the start, when when you could have gone in any direction. So I'm wondering, given all these domains you've worked in, all the immersion you've done, all the time that you've spent with experts in different domains, if you could do it all over, is there any particular domain uh that you might have like to have stuck with as a career?

**Speaker 3:** Wow, what a good question. Um, what would I do differently? I wouldn't change anything. I, you know, again, lucky guy, very lucky. Um, so, when I began with the Navy, I wanted to have impact and continue to to have impact. Never wanted to be an academic, but I said the world needs to know about what we're doing and so we published. Uh, and then when I became an academic, I said, wow, I can still have impact and and with more freedom. So, looking back, all the pieces all the pieces were in place for that have, um, gotten me where I am in terms of, uh, you know, this lifetime achievement award, which I very rewarding. And and and so I, you know, I'm struggling with this, but I am not, I cannot think of anything I would say I should have done something different. The path was by luck or by intention was perfect. 15 years doing applied work, working with the Navy, learning a hell of of a lot of things. Then as an academic getting young people to be energized about our fields, human factors and IO psychology, um, I wouldn't change anything.

**Speaker 2:** So so you wouldn't change anything, but is there any particular domain that you've worked with where in the back of your head you thought, gosh, if I was if I was not doing what I was doing, I'd really like to be doing this or I'd really like to be in this field or these I could do that job. I think I could do that job and I'd enjoy it. And any any thoughts about that?

**Speaker 3:** Well, if it wasn't an academic or you know, I always wanted to be a chef. I'm a foodie. Uh, and so I've been actually I've, you know, I read a lot of uh books from chefs because, um, they also create and develop teams. So, um, but another domain I I probably, um, would have like to have more methods, especially quasi experimental design, methods, uh, background and in expertise. Because everything for the last 30 years, 35 years, I've been doing this. everything is quasi experimental. You know, no randomization, so, um, I had one class only on quasi experimental design in grad school. And by the way, that's the only book that I still look at 35 years later the Cooking Campbell. Uh, but I think methods would have been something that I would have want more expertise, more education. Because at the end of the day, everything what matters, uh, uh, what what help us, help us, um, understand real experts is through methodologies. And so, um, that's that's I think the only thing I I would have liked to know more about different kinds of methods, especially quasi experimentation stuff. Um, and that's why sometimes I also look at, you know, anthropologist. Sometimes I feel that to study teams you have to be an anthropologist. You know, teams in the wild. You know, it you know, so it's methods.

**Speaker 1:** So you've spent a career studying experts in all kinds of domains. If you could instantly become an expert in anything at all, what would it be? What would you choose?

**Speaker 3:** Chefs, cooking.

**Speaker 1:** Is there a certain cuisine?

**Speaker 3:** Uh, well, I was going to say Peruvian but I don't uh no, uh, you know, uh, and by the way, that you know, the cooking channel and the food channel are the I'm I'm obsessed with those. I watched them more than anything else. Uh, so, not any cuisine, you know, uh, I I tell you what I've learned from from chefs and maybe this is part of me which is chefs are never happy. They're always searching for perfection, even though they get immediate feedback. Either they like your food or you don't. But they're always going, they keep going, improve, you know, the good chefs, you know, improving, uh, they have the passion for the food and and and and and they try things and and they keep keep going and so forth. And and and they teach, uh, you know, uh, others, the sue chefs and so that's what I I think, you know, in another life, if I come back, maybe I would have wanted to be a chef.

**Speaker 1:** So that allows you to combine a love of food with uh with team building, creating teams and

**Speaker 3:** Yeah.

**Speaker 1:** Nice. Well, thank you Eduardo for speaking with us today. It has been a pleasure to talk with you.
