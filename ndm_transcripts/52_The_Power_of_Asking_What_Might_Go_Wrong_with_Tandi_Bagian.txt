Okay, here is the transcript of the podcast episode with speaker diarization:

**Intro Voice:**
The Naturalistic Decision Making podcast with Brian Moon and Laura Milatello. This podcast series brings you interviews with leading NDM researchers who study and support people who make decisions under stress.

**Brian Moon:**
Welcome to the Naturalistic Decision Making podcast. This is Brian Moon from Perigean Technologies.

**Laura Milatello:**
And I'm Laura Milatello from Applied Decision Science. Our special guest today is Tany Bajjan. Tany has had a fascinating career. She earned her Bachelor's degree in engineering from the University of Washington in 1979 and soon after was employed by NASA's Johnson Space Center and served as lead instructor for astronaut crew training, flight projects manager for the Space Biomedical Research Institute, and head of the crew interface analysis section. This last position involved supervising six human factors laboratories to support NASA's space shuttle and space station missions. She was also a principal science coordinator for exploration human factors, and in that capacity informed the agency's advanced human support technology roadmap in preparation for Mars exploration mission definition. So how cool is that? But that's not all. In 1995, Tany transferred from NASA to the US Environmental Protection Agency and worked at the EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor. Along the way, she earned a Master of Science in Industrial and Operations Engineering from the University of Michigan. And then in 2012, Tany joined the Department of Veteran's Affairs as Director of the Human Factors Division for the VA National Center for Patient Safety. That team created an award-winning patient safety boot camp training for biomedical engineers across the entire VHA with a vision to make sure patient safety is everyone's business. NCPSS created strong technical partners across the over 170 VA Medical Centers, as well as with industry partners to assist healthcare professionals in providing safer systems, safer care. So, with 46 years of federal service under her belt, Miss Bajjan retired in 2022 and quickly became associated with the NASA Engineering and Safety Center's Human Factors Technical Discipline. And that's where we met. So this this human factors team is responsible for responding to requests for analysis and review of human factors issues across the NASA centers and commercial international partners committed to NASA's Moon to Mars mission. So welcome, Tany. Thank you for joining us. I'm so happy to have you this chance to talk with you and for our listeners to hear about your amazing work.

**Tany Bajjan:**
Thank you Laura, and thank you Brian.

**Laura Milatello:**
I always like to hear how people get started. So I wondered if you could tell us a little bit how you got started in 1979 when you graduated as a young woman with an engineering degree.

**Tany Bajjan:**
Oh, great. I love I love telling that story. I was one of those students that I I was the oldest of five kids. My dad was the high school science teacher. I loved learning my whole life. I liked maths and sciences and everything came easily and I got an offer for an engineering scholarship across the country from Seattle to go over to Rochester. So I said, cool, I haven't really lived over there, let's go. And just seeing the next level of everything to learn, rheology, thyrotropy, thermodynamics, I was just like, wow, I had never imagined. I thought learning is just easy, you'll learn it, you're done. So it really opened my mind and being one of the maybe three women in the large class of engineers at at the university level, I kept asking questions. You know, I'd go up afterwards and ask questions and my male colleagues would often say, you know, quit asking. It looks like you don't know anything. I'm like, well, I don't. I want to learn this stuff. So it was a real lucky coincidence to me that that I wasn't really someone that was shy or easily like offended or I wanted everybody to like me. I'm just like, look at all this cool stuff to learn. So I was asking questions that a lot of the professors were very eager to see their students asking, but I would apply them, like rheology, my report was on the rheology of ice cream. That's what I was interested in, you know, not like something that the engineering world would use. So the applications to me were things that I saw that I could use them on and that's kind of how I got started. Once I was at NASA, there was tons of stuff. I was between the Apollo and the shuttle program. So they hadn't flown or even finished all the shuttle mission design and the Apollo astronauts were still there, of course, and kind of ready to tell you what they learned. And I would ask them. And well, I learned a lot that my male engineering co-op colleagues often, but they'd feel a little too embarrassed. Well, they'll know I don't understand that. I'm like, wow. So that's how I got started. Just basically finding that there's a whole new level of stuff that I don't understand and wanting to ask the experts, how does this work and learning about it.

**Laura Milatello:**
Okay, so two things. One, you're using this term rheology as if I would have any idea what that is.

**Tany Bajjan:**
I didn't either, you know, it's about liquids and it's uh I mean this is from a long time ago now, but if you look up that like tropy is sort of like if you're painting, if you push the paint brush harder, it's thinner and the paint smears easier and as soon as you relieve pressure, it will stop. So it's a property of the liquid that changes under different situations. And I was just fascinated. I was like, wow, I never heard that either. So, it's it's fun to learn things you've never heard anything about. That that was like it.

**Laura Milatello:**
Especially if you can apply them to ice cream, like that's.

**Tany Bajjan:**
Exactly.

**Laura Milatello:**
So did you say that you co-opped with NASA? So even when you were a student, you started.

**Tany Bajjan:**
Yes, I started as a 19-year-old and basically six months down at Johnson Space Center and six months up at the University of Washington in Seattle until I graduated and then they offered me a full-time job down there. So I went and it was fascinating. Everything was changing, lots going on and a lot of people willing to ask the tough questions at the top level, but not a lot of the workforce that interested in showing that we don't have all the answers. So that dynamic of what is known and what do we wish we knew is something that I learned early on and that I think is kind of the hallmark of my path in life.

**Laura Milatello:**
Yeah, so I'm guessing your engineering degree didn't have a ton of human factors.

**Tany Bajjan:**
My undergrad did not, my graduate did, yeah.

**Laura Milatello:**
Yeah, so how did you I mean it seems like even very early in your career, you started migrating to human factors issues like how do you train people? Can you tell me like did you

**Tany Bajjan:**
Right.

**Laura Milatello:**
just naturally migrate in that direction out of curiosity or?

**Tany Bajjan:**
Right. So, thank you because it is fun when I think back on this and I haven't for a while. I was originally brought into the engineering director for propulsion and power, but I would ask different questions and they're like, this is the design, this is what we're building. I'm like, oh, all right, but how where's the why do you put the sensors there, you know? And so that was not a a good match for me and I went after that into the Mission Control Center and I'd always wanted to ask the questions and they're like, look, we just have to say go or no go. I'm like, yeah, but there's something we don't know and that might affect them. They're like, okay, nope, you can't do that. By the time we're ready, you just have to say based on what we already practiced for go. I said, but we didn't practice everything. That's okay, you know, we just do what we can and I was like, oh my goodness. So then they put me in crew training and that was also when the first women astronauts were coming in and, you know, I could tailor based on who I was training, what questions did they have? So I saw the range of questions rather than here the eight things you need to know in order to operate this robotic arm on the Space shuttle. I could say, you know, what are you comfortable? Are you near this and kind of tailor it and then listen to what the individual users saw and then some would see things that others couldn't see, which I had to kind of go, okay, you know, not everybody perceives things the same way. And some would see other interactions with other systems that no one else had thought about. So it was fascinating to me to look at the human as part of the system and say what role does that human have? What insight on the human will impact how the whole system performs? So that's where I got into that human in the loop stuff and then they pulled me over and asked me to supervise the human factors labs. And there I would continue to bring astronauts over and say, all right, space station needs some hand controllers. These are the six international hand controllers. Let's use them all and see what we like about each one and, you know, understand it as opposed to just pick one, which was kind of the normal engineering way. Well, this one is cheaper or this one is more robust or whatever. Let's see which one responds better to the range of users in the range of situations. So once I started doing that, everyone kind of had an aha moment like, well, we all should be doing that. I'm like, yeah, you really all should be doing that. And and so that was very satisfying to see going from scripting unusual situations for simulation training into proactively assessing what are the potential system applications and system components and how does the human interact with each one? It was very fun. I would want someone to look at what I'm good at and match me up with what I'm good at as opposed to something that really is hard for me to be successful with.

**Laura Milatello:**
Yeah, so one of the things I having spoken to you, I have admired about your work is this kind of very pragmatic given what challenges we have in front of us and what resources we have available, what's the best way we can answer these questions, which I think resonates a lot with the NDM community. A lot of times we're doing that same thing. We're in these very applied places and we just got to figure out what's the best way to answer this question. So I remember you told me this great story about just coming up with a way to assess workload. I'm wondering if you'd share that.

**Tany Bajjan:**
Sure, I'd be glad to. In my transition from working in Houston and then kind of trying to figure out for future exploration, how we'd partner the human crew member with the automation, you know, the computer parts. There should be a way for the human and the computer to have a handshake to say, hey, how are you doing? How are you doing? So we train the astronaut to know when the computer is failing and what to do about it. We haven't trained the computer to notice the astronaut might be falling asleep. And it just reminds me when you're on a road trip, the co-pilot or in aviation, will kind of notice, hey, you know, maybe I could take over for a while. And you and you learn to work as a team. This is step one of teaming. Teaming with automation back then was brand new, controlling the automation. Teaming, not so much. So looking at the way that we could in the future when you're in a three-year Mars round trip mission, say, hey pal, you know, human, it looks like you're needing a little more rest. Why don't we shed some of your tasks and let me take over some of this stuff and take a little nap. And detecting when that workload is exceeding things was a lot of the research that I got to see are the NASA group of researchers who are brilliant that build over decades of cognitive and and scientific research slowly and surely. I motions and different things that correlate to alertness and attentiveness. I don't understand a lot of it. I love reading it. It's fascinating. But what I would notice is when people started getting, if I put too many simulation cases, when they started getting overload, they would focus and focus and if they happened to be gum chooers and a lot of pilots that I was training happened to be gum chooers, their pattern would change. If they were fast gum chooers all of a sudden they'd slow their gum chewing while they're trying to figure something out. And once they knew it they were hose, they'd just go back to their normal gum chewing and like, okay, I lost. I didn't understand this. I couldn't control it. And the the ones that were slower would get faster. And and, you know, just it would be a different pattern. So while I was with the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, Dr. Paul Green and I looked at other ways to look at this for driver workload because at that time, we were introducing all of the GPS systems and how much can you be telling the driver as as another task? How far before the intersection do they need to pay attention without impacting the primary driving task? And so I said, you know, I kind of did this stuff, let's get a video game, I used Dr. Mario and get some of these grad student engineers and look at it, at what point can you tell that they've sort of went, okay, I'm maxed out. I've lost control, I'm going to lose this level. And we were able to do that and he was able to publish it and do the statistics and stuff that I wasn't used to doing. I can observe them but I can't usually do the study that's going to be robust and publishable. That's why I need to be part of a team that knows how to do that part.

**Laura Milatello:**
Yeah, so I love that just creative ways to think about workload in this really unobtrusive way, where you're noticing things like the change in their gum chewing. Yeah, that's fascinating.

**Brian Moon:**
Tany, it sounds like going back, you've spent a lot of time in your career trying to persuade people as a 19-year-old female engineer that feels like you're trying to persuade people to listen to you, maybe first of all, but also persuade them about which directions to go in and and why we need to question some things. I'm kind of wondering if there's been any times when you've had trouble persuading people about directions to go and kind of how you work through those.

**Tany Bajjan:**
Absolutely. And again, luckily, I was either naive enough or bold enough, you know, it wasn't about how do I feel? It was like, but wait a minute, what happens if this happens, you know? So, because I was sort of rare as a female engineer at NASA, some of the things I'd script, people would roll their eyes like, oh, for patient's sake, this will never happen. One of them that I had shared with Laura is, you know, back in the days of the early space shuttle, there was an acquisition signal and then a loss of signal. You really only had a couple minutes over the satellite stations to talk to the crew that are that are in the space shuttle. And so you'd organize things and when the acquisition signal came on, the person that talks to the crew is a fellow astronaut called the Capcom. That's because they know each other, they train together, they're the ones that can kind of hear there's some emotion in the voice. Well, one of the things I scripted and it got approved and everything is, you know, what would happen if the Capcom astronaut happened to be out of the Mission Control Center during a pass and people are like, oh, that wouldn't happen. I'm like, well, let's imagine, let's say, you know, he's in the bathroom or and someone passes out or he needs to give aid or he got on an important phone call, I mean, for whatever reason, it's just two minutes past, you know, what would happen? They said, oh, all right, I don't think that anything would happen. So, during that simulation, you know, I took the guy and said, oh, guess what, your elevator's stuck because he was going down to get a cup of coffee. And he's like, you're kidding me because they knew that I would script stuff like that. And, you know, they weren't pleased. They're like, come on, we got real training to do. But sure enough, when the acquisition signal came along, nobody else reached over to the other console microphone to speak to it. There's no key. It's just who can talk and and they missed a whole pass of data. So that was a really good thing. It's not like I get to say, see, you didn't know it. It's they get to have the discussion of, wow, how prepared are we? How resilient are we? So the more you can uncover before the real mission, allows them to be a little more ready for anything. Readiness is an important part of space flight. And that has kind of been my theme, why wouldn't you want to talk about what could go wrong and what you could do about it? So that you have options should it happen. I've been told, it's not so much that I had to convince people, but when I bring those things up, especially in healthcare, I worked there 10 years, people would say, Tany, you're so negative. Why do you think of all these things that go wrong? I'm like, no, I'm not. I'm the most optimistic person because I think you're going to be ready for all these. I don't think you're ever going to be caught off guard and therefore some patient suffers. You don't want that to happen. I know you don't. So let me help you be more ready, more prepared, a more resilient organization. So it's not so much that I had to convince them. It's that I just didn't give up. I like, you want to be ready for everything. And many of the things justifiably they would tell me are very rare, probably wouldn't happen, but I'm like, yeah, but if they did, could you tell? Is it detectable? Can we make it more detectable? So now you can anticipate and take a different course of action so that your mission is successfully completed.

**Brian Moon:**
I'm wondering did you use some of those early stories to convince folks later on that trying the rare things?

**Tany Bajjan:**
No, because that makes it about me, you know? There were some times when I was really felt horrible. My classic one was before the first space shuttle launch, one of my systems, I was in charge of the remote manipulator system, making sure that the astronauts could use the robotic arm, but I also was working the thermal control system, the tile on the bottom of the shuttle and I had gone out to where they make it. I had used the Air Force models of entry heating and what that does to the bottom surface of the space shuttle and if there happened to be damage tile, how could we alter our entry our trajectory and re-ach the heating, so you would not lose the mission. And I put that in our training computers, motion base and stationary based simulator. So the astronauts could see how did your entry trajectory impact your heating. And a lot of that people were like, uh, we don't think it's important, but go ahead, put it in. And I learned a lot of what the Air Force knew and what others knew about these interesting new materials, you know, the aluminum structure and then on top of that, the silicon pretty fragile little tile surfaces and stuff. So I would practice, I scripted it and we before the first shuttle launch, I had scripted this loss of tile simulation and had approval from my bosses, had engaged the Johnson Space Center photography department, they had never been asked to be part of a simulation. They got a nice picture of the shuttle and airbrushed in some plumes as if it's launching and then filmed down shaking it so that it looked like the rockets going up and so we made a video that looked like little tile had come off. And so at this three-day simulation and this was, you know, Gene Krans the flight controller, the guy with the vest from Apollo 13, after it launched, we had simulated that the Kennedy Space Center would say, uh, Houston, there's some tile on the pad and you might want to look at your playback cameras and all the mission control centers look over to me in the simulation area like, cameras? We don't, why would we have cameras? We haven't launched a shuttle yet. So they didn't even know the photography people had made this. So it let them prepare, let them pull out the drawings, you know, we're talking big engineering drawings and lay them all over and say, okay, if this fails, what would that burn through and get the hydraulic lines or what would happen? What could we control? So they were able to have that dialogue and then a day and a half into this three-day simulation, the top NASA leadership came over all the mics and said, there will be no loss of tile. And my bosses looked at me furiously and the crew just sort of said, oh, I guess we saw something different and went on and that was the political layer because I didn't know or didn't appreciate that that was a very sensitive topic that the agency had decided, you know what? There are things we've made a risk decision and we don't want to talk about the fact that if the tile didn't work 100%, there could be, you know, issues possibly. My goal was to want to be ready for them. The other goal was like, what if you can't do anything? So sure enough, after the first shuttle launched, actual cape came over the actual lines and said, uh, there's a bunch of tile on the launch pad, you know, you might want to look into what we can know. And the control center was very pleased. Gene Krans came over and gave a thumbs up through the window, like, thank you. We're a day and a half more prepared than we would have been if we just found this on launch day. And, you know, there are some things you can't do, you can do, but there's always the risk that there's something you you won't be able to survive. And that's kind of one of those questions is, do you practice the one you know, you can't do anything about? That doesn't really help. So that is where I learned there's, you know, a limit to what's useful if there's nothing you could do about it. But then I always think, but what if there's something we haven't thought of in the last 20 years? Maybe now we could do something about it. So it's a balance between people thinking I'm negative and me eternally optimistic that we'll find a way to be better prepared for things we hadn't expected.

**Laura Milatello:**
Wow, that was an amazing story.

**Tany Bajjan:**
Don't tell too many people that, probably not smart to put it on a podcast, but it's true, you know, I I do this all the time in education and in in healthcare, two things that need to change to keep up with what's happening in our world, and it's not hard. You don't have to worry and it shouldn't be driven out of fear. It's just what's a better way to make sure what I learned can be learned by you. How can I do that? You know? So that's kind of what I'm excited to be doing with NASA's teams right now. Very rewarding.

**Laura Milatello:**
Yeah. So in addition to your work at NASA, you've also had this really influential role with the VA, and I was you mentioned AI a few minutes ago, you know, everyone is talking about introducing AI and advanced automation, to transform the way we work. And I'm wondering having worked for NASA and EPA and the VA, are there any kind of insights or lessons learned you can share about introducing these kinds of smart tools into a complex system?

**Tany Bajjan:**
I have thoughts about it, but I need to make sure everyone realizes I am not a master of these complex tools at all. But what I have learned is that readiness is a journey, sort of Lewis and Clark or, you know, any of those explorers, there's a basic set of tools, but then when you meet something else that you hadn't expected, you might have to get creative. What I have found is if you as an organization aren't on a readiness journey, you won't be able to use those tools because first of all, do you have a shared common goal? If you're not trying to achieve the same goal, anything you contribute might not fit together and you wouldn't even know it. So is there a shared goal? Are there standard processes that you're all going to agree you're going to start with? So that when you combine things, they make sense to combine. And then do you have a trusted team where you can say, hmm, let me confirm. Do I understand this right? Is this what you're seeing? Is this what you're concerned about? If you aren't comfortable speaking up, you cannot get the other insights. So, for healthcare, which is my passion, we'll all need it, and I see the very smart people that commit so many years of their professional life to become clinicians and are feeling more and more burnt out and this isn't what they signed up to do and just, you know, it's a frustrating thing for many. What I see is enough is changing that these smart people have been told to work in sort of what we would call at NASA a frozen design, you know, like in the Space shuttle they used real to real tapes for the computer memory, you know, I mean, but that had to stay there because we knew the bugs in that one to import anything else and with all the newer technology would have introduced a risk we couldn't assess in time. So as things are changing in healthcare, people aren't encouraged to talk about it. It's like, well, a good doctor would know how to do this and I'm like, well, this isn't the one I trained on. Well, you should know how to it's just like, whoa. So I see the disconnects of how to become a trusted team of people with the same goal and until that happens, using the amazing new tools are going to look at a commonality of purpose to maybe better tailor what you're doing with the device, with the team, whatever. That can all be done and that's what NASA is looking at, you know, if you're building something, you've got so many standards and requirements to meet that maybe they all don't address your specific project. How could we use some of these AI tools to kind of tailor what is actually going to be implementable for your design? And I think they call it digital threads. Stuff like that that they're looking at, that's because there's a very common theme and a goal for the folks that have to try to design something that people can stay alive and do meaningful work with a three-year round trip mission. We know that's tough right there. Healthcare, people somehow think once you're trained, you can go do the job and different nurses see different things, different doctors see different things, different admin people see different things, but there isn't a forum to welcome that. It's just like, hey, I'm busy, you do your job, I'll do my job. Someone delivers you a device, you assume it's clean. Of course they would have cleaned it. Well, why can't we check that? You know, I just as a human factors thing, why can't we confirm that? Not because we doubt them, but because we're human and is there a way to confirm that what we assume is the situation is the situation. So, I think that's the part that I feel for healthcare. There are amazing good tools that could be used once we're all working together. And with 170 plus hospitals in the VA, I could get them together, you know, a veteran can go into any VA hospital, their records are there. They it's like one huge hospital system. But in an individual hospital, you have to advertise. You have to say, hey, we're the best, we have an open MRI, we have whatever because they need money. The money is the object. Not that they don't want to give good care, but with so many hospitals all over the country, it's easy to see what's different in the VA hospital and it's easy to say, now that's a diverse set of tasks, not just one way to do everything. And what can we learn about when the different ways to do things would actually be better for the mission of safe and effective care? So I really am excited that as healthcare starts not feeling like they're admitting to fault or being human, but actually saying, how can I confirm the status of my system and that we're all ready, the devices are ready, everything's clean, that people all are well rested, nobody's struggling in the middle of an emotional something and they're not feeling like trusting their teammates, there's a lot of things that are changing quickly in healthcare and I think we have to start now to work together as the different threats of malware or counterfeit or all the different things that are creeping into our software and hardware systems. If the people aren't able to say, hey, did any of the rest of you guys see that without fear of thinking, oh, well, it must just be me, you know? And when I worked with a lot of the the clinical residents, they all individually say, well, I, you know, I really have imposter syndrome. I really think that all the other residents are so much smarter than me and I said, okay, 100% of you guys all said you are having imposter syndrome. So, something else is different. You had some expectations or something's not being explained to your satisfaction and now you're not sure you're ready for the job, you know? So it is so fascinating dimensionally with not just the technology, but the psychology and the need to feel comfortable and confident that what you're doing is the right thing, when you really will never know. You you start with a path that is the best fit, but you might have to change and that's a lot of pressure.

**Laura Milatello:**
Yeah, so I think a theme I'm hearing maybe regardless of whether it's space travel or transportation or healthcare, is that you're thinking at this very high system level, like how can we create a system where the humans trust each other, where they are able to speak critically about the technology, be creative about how to use the technology, but how do we create a system at this high level that can anticipate perturbations, react to those? Is that a a reasonable?

**Tany Bajjan:**
Yep, and realize that that's okay. Things aren't always going to go just the way you decided they should go, you know? You're going to come.

**Laura Milatello:**
They never do.

**Tany Bajjan:**
Right, you know, so to be ready and excited to anticipate early signals of, huh, this isn't quite what I thought, so what do I need to do differently? It should be a very natural discussion, but when we demand perfection and we say the way we always did it is the right way, then we're like tying our own hands behind our back.

**Laura Milatello:**
Right, right, and in healthcare there are all kinds of checklists and procedures and protocols that you're supposed to follow to a T for, you know, because it's a best practice and legal.

**Tany Bajjan:**
Right.

**Laura Milatello:**
Yeah. So that's a culture that in some ways is adverse to the kind of flexibility that's needed.

**Tany Bajjan:**
Right. And space travel has to date the space exploration, you've been able to come up with a nominal mission. And if you design it all perfectly, those little rovers on Mars work perfectly, you know? With the human there, there's quite a bit more opportunity to have things go differently than anticipated because the human is deciding what to do on the fly, you know? So it's exciting stuff.

**Brian Moon:**
It seems like there's a doubling up too. There's not only the expectation of the perfection piece, but if they're not doing some of the readiness activities that you were describing early, then there's an expectation to be perfect and we haven't prepared for anything else.

**Tany Bajjan:**
That's exactly right, Brian. And that's the thing. There's this huge gap. If all these smart people could just say and and I've had success creating exercises for them to see that that, you know, if we all can learn what one person has seen, then even if we can't imagine it, haven't done it before, we are now prepared for it. And it's like we're just so close to making that little bridge in my mind. I'm sure we're not really close but I can see it could easily happen.

**Laura Milatello:**
So you probably know this just from your practical experience, but there's a group at Arizona State University, Nancy Cook and Jamie Gorman have done some cool work showing that if you train teams and give them, they call them perturbations, but, you know, coms equipment breaks down,

**Tany Bajjan:**
Exactly.

**Laura Milatello:**
that they're not just better at dealing with broken coms equipment, they're better at dealing with other kinds of perturbations. So,

**Tany Bajjan:**
They developed a team behavior. They realize and value that a different perspective could be complementary to theirs or something they hadn't thought of. I think that what you find is when you practice like you're describing, you develop another behavior pattern that allows you to work as an effective team and they've done that a lot in aviation. They've told them how to speak when you're in the cockpit, this is what you do, and it makes you welcome all the different perspectives as opposed to, well, that's not what we're supposed to do. So, yeah, I think that's one of the things that I will probably be most remembered for in the healthcare world is since I am not a clinician and not anybody that's worked in a hospital, I would have to use everyday kind of examples and I've a couple years in a row, I'd take a hundred of our patient safety managers or chief nurses that are in charge of patient safety in a conference setting and say, okay, we are going to look at making smores. And, you know, some people don't notice smores, but basically, look at the different steps. You're doing a proactive risk assessment, you're going to get the fire ready, you know, make the fire, cook the thing and then clean up, stage four, that no one remembers. And I did this with some students in in a middle school and I I actually was a pre- group that was going into their high school robotics, so they could the the goal was to value the insights that someone else might have as opposed to, oh, oh, I know the answer. Good, you got the answer right. So, when with 100 different people just looking at preparations for going out and making smores, one person out of that hundred said, do you need a permit for a fire? And everyone else was like, oh, yeah, I was thinking dry wood, matches. Yeah, I know, what what happens if you don't have a permit for the fire? Now, the risk probably isn't huge that someone's going to come and say, I'm sorry, you can't have your fire today, you don't have a permit. But the fact that that's something that is part of the task, it was a shock to everybody else like, oh, yeah, you're supposed to do that in many of these shelters where we'd be bringing our cub scouts or girl scouts. So, that made everybody much more appreciative, like, whoa, all right, so if we kind of pulls together this list of things you'd want to be prepared for and you'd want to check, it's sort of like a good coach, you know, like, hey, do you need this? And you're like, oh, I didn't even think of that. Thank you. So now you're welcoming the different perspectives. And they all loved it and and I said, this is exactly how you're going to talk about your healthcare cases. Hey, you know, do we know anything about what this patient's, you know, family members are doing right now and their expectations to come visit instead of, well, that's not my job to ask that question. It's like, oh, that's a good question, you know? So now you're working together and you see the value of somebody else's as opposed to everyone's in their silo. If you do your job well and then I do my job well and the next person does, then everything is as good as it can be. So, it's fun to help people open their eyes to appreciate the different perspectives.

**Brian Moon:**
Can I just pull on that piece a bit in terms of you've worked in these large government organizations and it sounds like at times you've been successful, again, I'll come back to the persuasion piece, in persuading folks who need to get work done to take some time and do training, do learning, do some team building, you know, to do activities that are going to put people in a state of cognitive readiness. I'm just wondering if if you can think about times when it was hard to convince those people that we need to take this step and get ready as opposed to we just need to go for it. Especially I imagine that's hard in health care.

**Tany Bajjan:**
Yes, so you are hitting the toughest nail in in the whole board when you're trying to construct this. If you can get the ground level folks to appreciate why they'd want to do this, they'll start doing it anyway. As soon as it gets to the leaders, if the leaders are like, hey, what's the return on investment here? Am I making more money? That's when you have to help, as a large community has to say, well, you know what? Actually, you are because now I'm not home depressed with so many sick days and but the answers actually have to come from those who believe that what they're now doing is adding value because I can't assign a return on investment. Even with the whole VHA, I could say, hey, the fact that this hospital in Idaho found this, now I can put out a patient safety alert that makes every VHA hospital aware and actions that they need to take that I can confirm that they took, if I don't say here's what's harm avoided and what that might cost, their bosses are like, why are we wasting our time doing this? We didn't have this happen. But you could. You still could. It's in our system, you still could. So, that's the disconnect that I've just don't have the talent. I do not have political acumen, I do not have financial, economic, and those are huge drivers. So, I'm limited by having a bucket full of potential solutions and then having others sort of say, well, this one's actually not as bad as the others. We can swallow this one. I'm like, okay, we'll start there. Because if you can get the folks who are actually doing the job they believe in, that they want to do well. No one comes to work at a hospital to kill somebody and when it happens they're devastated or harm somebody. If you can help them see that this activity as a community makes sure all of us are better prepared, they they want to do it. They're so grateful. They'll call me day and night and say, thank you, you know, I I didn't really know how to do this. I'm like, oh, well, guess what? We get 4,000 reports a week from our whole system of other people that might have the same thing. If you want to know, just ask. So, it it makes them feel good, but then at the end of the day, the very top leaders of an individual hospital, has to say, this is important. We're setting aside time for this to learn from what happened that surprised us and to put into place things that we think will make it less likely to happen and confirm that it actually did. And a lot of times you've sold the hospital to two other people and have, you know, four different new CEOs and they've got to start all over. So, it's not going to be easy, but to help the people trying to do this very tough mission, I think it's essential, honestly.

**Laura Milatello:**
And I'll just put a little plug for the VA in there. I think the VA is better able to do this than private healthcare lots of times.

**Tany Bajjan:**
I definitely do because I see what we see and I know it's in private sector, but, you know, they won't believe they have it. Oh, we never had that yet. I'm like, oh, well, just a matter of time.

**Laura Milatello:**
Yeah, and the VA is great about actually reporting things.

**Tany Bajjan:**
Yes, and sharing, you know, we used to post everything we found. A lot of times the political folks are like, it makes it look like we have more bad things happen than private sector. I'm like, well, you know. So we found other ways to make sure that the private sector can become aware of emerging challenges. I think, you know, one of the things that we had talked about is what's been the most satisfying thing in my career and my career is satisfying because of an attitude, not a project. But the one project that just surprised me in a wonderful way is toward the end of my last year or so of the VA, one of the top folks in the VA, not in the Veteran's Health Administration, but in the top office reporting the Secretary, called and said, are you the one that always says what could go wrong? I was like, well, yes I am. She said, well, we're introducing a second COVID vaccine and we're not really sure what it'll be like because it's a different buying time, it's a different expiration length. You know, it's got some things different and if people mix up the two COVID vaccines, you know, that's not going to be good. I said, what a great thing to do, you know, let's look proactively at the whole, every step that needs to happen and say what could go wrong and what could we do to make sure it can't go wrong? And they loved it and then we put it out to the hospitals and as they learned more, we added to it and then this top office would put out a checklist saying, here's what else we learned to be ready for and to do. And, you know, my name's not on it. I didn't get any credit, but the fact that I was annoying enough to always be saying, you know, let's learn from this, they called. So, that made me so happy. Like, yes, if we all did that and then gave it to the private sector, you know, we wouldn't have so many misadministrations.

**Laura Milatello:**
That's great. So, as you look back over your career, what have you found to be the most fulfilling project?

**Tany Bajjan:**
I think that's what I was kind of hitting on. I I reflected on that because I've had a lot of fulfilling projects, but what I realized is my joy is in the attitude and approach that I was able to influence. So whether I was coaching eight-year-old soccer or testing cars for compliance, very boring. If you ask the people who are participating, what are you wishing you knew more about? What are you seeing? What do you wish you could change and better understand and they trust you enough to tell you, then when you implement it, it starts the cycle where they realize, oh, I don't have to just keep doing this stupid thing the same way. If I have an idea, if I don't speak up about it, then it can't ever happen. But they've kind of assumed they're probably been conditioned that no one wants somebody saying, well, that's just, you know, here's another idea, we we do it the way we do it. I got it, you know. And so, I think that has been the satisfaction and I I saw it in all of my assignments in all three federal agencies, but also in my personal life and just when you can help people believe in the power of the community of experience as opposed to, well, you don't do it the right way, you know? It's like, oh, well, who says there's one right way? You know? So, that's been really satisfying. And I think that's probably why I was eager to do this podcast is I see it in almost every work setting that the more you're willing to ask someone, is it, what do you see? And believe that they care to help you work with them and to reach a common goal. It all has to be goal centric. I have been foiled by people who are themselves centric and take what I'm doing and say, oh, I just thought of this because they think it's going to make them look good. I don't mind they get credit for it, but I'm like, that shouldn't be why you're doing this to look good. So anyway, if you see that kind of dawning, a shared commitment to reach the mission, what a great thing.

**Brian Moon:**
It also seems to me that if someone's coming to you and saying, aren't you the person who always wonders what's going to go wrong, then that organization is not thinking about what could go wrong. Right? If they're signaling out someone, you know, a red team or the devil's advocate or the wrong lady, then that organizational culture is not such that

**Tany Bajjan:**
I have seen it everywhere, Brian because I'm looking for it. I've seen it in education. Why are you thinking this? I'm like, I'm not, I'm just asking. I've seen it in, oh, so many things. I mean, there isn't a walk of life that I haven't seen asking that question makes people cringe because it kind of offends their security zone or something.

**Brian Moon:**
Have you seen organizations where you felt that that sort of ethos was a bit more ingrained in just the day-to-day work that they were more ready to look for the things that could go wrong just as as a culture, that's sort of the way that the thing.

**Tany Bajjan:**
Yes, and that is actually the long way around to say that's what I learned as a 19-year-old at Johnson Space Center. That's how we do it. That's how we ask about how are we designing the show. But I would keep asking even once we've made a decision on baseline design because I kind of wanted to keep thinking, well, what do we should we watch for in case it doesn't operate the way we thought? You know? And that's beyond what an organization has the capacity to do most of the time. It's like, this is the car we're building. Don't now ask, wow, what would happen if we put, you know, the tail lights here? It's like, once you decide you're making a design, it's kind of too late to make the input. So I don't believe that. I believe you should keep a running list of, these are things I have questions about in case at some point, there's an opportunity to understand it better and therefore use it better, achieve your mission better.

**Laura Milatello:**
So I think you said that NASA was really pretty good at this at having this mind.

**Tany Bajjan:**
Excellent at it. Yes. But then what I found the limit of NASA is they have to baseline something. You have to say, this is what we're doing. We're not making any changes because we've done our risk assessment. And then over operations as you learn new things, sometimes you can maybe use them, but you don't understand what that did to the original risk calculation. Or sometimes it's like, yeah, that's nice but we're not doing that because we don't understand how that might impact. I'm like, well, why don't we start understanding? It's like, you know, so for me, it doesn't have to be one or the other. I want that bridge. I want, here are the things I'd like to understand better and let that inform the research agenda and let that inform the testing, not just like, oh, we should test only the things I know I need to know. That's a great start, but then let's keep going. And when I found Laura, I was like, wow, I like this idea of naturalistic decision making because in nature, you see a lot of adaptation. Something changes, something else changes. It's like, wow, okay. There must be a tradeoff. If something else in nature changes, at some point, if it wasn't a good idea, that thing becomes extinct, you know? So and I can't I can't wrap my head around it, but I I'm committed to the fact that we're not that different from the rest of nature that as we start thinking about challenges and we see new ways to keep a to-do list of things we think we should understand a little better, that we can actually get to them.

**Laura Milatello:**
Yeah, and I think part of what the naturalistic decision-making community is all about is that we can't control everything. So we have to be adaptive and humans are naturally adaptive. And so how can we support that and nurture that and grow that kind of expertise? Yeah.

**Tany Bajjan:**
And, you know, and one of the things when I was thinking about this my very first podcast thing is as I learned more about sciences and chemistry and physics and biology, I kept forgetting, oh, yeah, this is only good with an ideal gas. Oh, yeah, this is a, you know, so the limits of what I was taught decades ago, it's all under certain conditions that are very well controlled. And how do we go from that to space time continuum, you know? It's like, well, I can't really control that. We don't understand that at all. So that that journey into feeling comfortable that we don't know the answers, I think that's the hardest part.

**Laura Milatello:**
So let me just ask, what advice would you have for a young person starting out?

**Tany Bajjan:**
I really am interested in people understanding that life's a journey. I have had so many young children, teens, college kids, graduate students, early career people say, well, I don't know what I want to do. And I've tried to kind of say, you know, I never know what I'm going to do, but I know what I'm interested in and who I want to be. You know, I don't have a job to say, oh, I have this job. I have a job to do the job. So, when I find something that I want to do, that's what I want to be. And I don't think it makes sense to a lot of people, but it has served me well to whatever I'm excited about, kind of say, wow, you know, how does this work? You do have to make an income, you know, I get it and not everybody has had whatever confidence or naivete to feel like it's okay to ask questions and I get that, you know, some people have been not rewarded at all for that or negatively rewarded. I think one of the things that you had kind of talked about before is sort of, who has influenced the way you think and I have had a lot of amazing people in in my life. A lot of amazing astronaut people that have done a whole bunch that have an emotional life that they've shared with me and I have seen different sides of people and I've got lovely family members and all sorts of folks that I just really admire. There's one happen stance that I had with Alan Bean. And it wasn't because he knows me, but because he was a friend of my husband's. And we had lunch in a little place called Tuckies down there by Johnson Space Center. And he was someone who had been a Navy pilot and walked on the moon and been in Skylab and had done a million things and then he decided he wanted to become an artist. He'd been an astronaut and he wanted to become an artist and it was so interesting to hear him talk about why he wanted to be an artist because he had seen things on the moon that he wanted to share with other people. And he told us that it's so much harder to learn to be an artist than it was to be a pilot or an engineer or all the other things because you have to learn how the people will perceive what you're doing. And I was just fascinated. I was just like, I didn't say a word. He said, like the moon is not color. It's just gray, but I had to add color so that people could feel what I felt on the moon. And that has stuck with me my entire life. It's like, wow, you tried a whole different career. You were successful at everything. You picked something that was really, really hard because you wanted to communicate to the rest of humanity what it felt like to be on the moon. I don't even know how I use that information, but the fact he chose to use color when scientifically and engineering, there's just blacks and whites and dust and gray because that would help the human better perceive what he was able to feel. I just found that and blew me away. So, that would be the one thing I would encourage other young people that are starting out to look what would make you feel like what you did mattered. It could be something simple, but just it it matters, you know.

**Laura Milatello:**
Yeah, that's great advice. Okay, so this is the last question we ask everyone. If you could instantly achieve expertise in anything, anything at all, what would you choose?

**Tany Bajjan:**
Instantly achieve expertise. I'm not sure I'm an expert in anything at all. But I think I would like to be able to try on someone else's perspective. I think when I have looked into the things we are designing and developing for Mars and I put on the goggles at the Marshall Space Flight Center lab there and go into the immersive technology and they're like, do you think that's enough room to do this and that? And I'm like, this is so cool. I how do I get someone else who has actually done critical procedure to appreciate this new world that's a blend of zero gravity and there's no up and down and the normal clinical tasks you've been taught. So how could you just somehow put on somebody else's perspective? And I was always taught try walking in someone else's moccasins to appreciate their perspective, but what would that actually feel like? So if I could do it, I would love to be able to just put on a cap and feel like you for a day, Laura or, you know, just sort of see what somebody else's perspectives are. I'd like to do that.

**Laura Milatello:**
Wow, that might be my favorite answer to that question ever.

**Tany Bajjan:**
And the most impossible, who knows.

**Laura Milatello:**
Oh, gosh, Tany, well, thank you for speaking with us today. This has been so fun.

**Tany Bajjan:**
Well, thank you.

**Laura Milatello:**
Yeah. So on that note, thank you for joining us for the NDM podcast. I'm Laura Milatello.
