**Speaker 1:** The Naturalistic Decision Making Podcast with Brian Moon and Laura Millattello. This podcast series brings you interviews with leading NDM researchers who study and support people who make decisions under stress.

**Speaker 2:** Welcome to the Naturalistic Decision Making Podcast. This is Laura Millattello from Applied Decision Science.

**Speaker 3:** And I'm Brian Moon from Paergine Technologies.

**Speaker 2:** Today, we welcome Jan Martin Schraagen. Jan Martin is principal scientist at TNO, and also professor of applied cognitive psychology at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. His research interests include resilience engineering, team communication processes, and human machine teaming. He is the lead editor on two influential volumes. So cognitive task analysis came out in 2000, and I think that was the first book devoted to that topic. And then also naturalistic decision making and macro cognition, which came out in 2008, and the this one captured uh some of the best papers from the NDM meeting that Jan Jan Martin hosted in Amsterdam. He is also co-editor of the recently released Oxford Handbook of expertise, which uh both Brian and I contributed chapters to. He is editor-in-chief of the Journal of cognitive engineering and decision making. And for those who don't know that journal, it's a non-traditional journal that was created uh specifically as an outlet for the types of non-traditional studies that NDM researchers tend to do. Dr. Schraagen holds a PhD in cognitive psychology from the University of Amsterdam. So welcome Jan Martin. Thanks for joining us today.

**Speaker 4:** Thank you for having me.

**Speaker 2:** I wanted to start and uh go back in time and ask if you can remember the first paper that you ever published and tell us a little bit about that.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, sure. Um, so the first paper I published was a paper in memory and cognition in 1988 and it was on visual working memory in young children. Um, it was based on the work that I carried out as part of my master's thesis in Manchester, England with Graham Hitch and Sebastian Holiday. And actually, the paper was mostly written by Graham Hitch. So I need to be modest about the writing part. Um, but all the experiments reported in that paper were carried out by myself. Uh, I did a lot of memory testing at primary schools in the greater Manchester area at that time with both four-year-olds and 11-year-olds and comparing the development of visual and auditory working memory. Um, so that was actually the the first published paper. I think the the second one is, if I can continue a little bit on that, but I'll leave it at that then. Um, the second one is is really the one that I was solely responsible for and that was a paper that I published in cognitive science in 1993. And it was part of my PhD thesis. Uh, that was about how experts can or cannot transfer their expertise from one area to another when the areas are still somewhat related. Um, so in this case, it was about designing experiments in areas that you are familiar with versus areas that you are unfamiliar with. So, I think those were the really two, you know, first papers, the one in 1988, I did not contribute in writing a whole lot to and the the other one I did write by myself.

**Speaker 2:** Well, the first one interviewing children sounds fun. Was that was that or not interviewing, but but running having having them do various memory tests, was that um, was that fun or was it difficult or both or?

**Speaker 4:** Yeah. Um, you know, there were there were memory tests. So what we actually did was um, present those children with, um, um, with pictures of objects, um, for a brief time and then turn them down, and then so you got like either three pictures, you know, which was the most that a four-year-old could do. And for 11-year-olds, we went up to I think five or maybe even seven uh pictures, you know, the typical typical kind of memory span. Um, but they were they were pictures of objects that that they had to look at briefly and then had to recall in order, in the order they were presented. Um, it was mostly fun, but um, we experimented a lot with the task and I recall one particular task, um, that we tried that was kind of a rule induction task. Um, and it was it was quite complicated actually. So you presented a couple of um, uh pictures and then the child had to pick up the rule according to which the pictures were presented. And I remember we tried it out with a couple of four-year-olds, but they all started to cry. So, um, we we we we quit that procedure very quickly. It was it was just too difficult for them.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so that sounds like very kind of uh traditional experimental research, although it is field research, you're going out and and well, I mean, there there is some uh some kind of naturalistic element to that perhaps, um, because you're going to the primary schools where they where they are. Um, but then the next study you mentioned in 1993 where now you're really thinking about expertise.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah.

**Speaker 2:** Was that um, was that still a traditional experimental design or were you doing any kind of cognitive field methods there?

**Speaker 4:** Well, I I wanted to, and so I wanted to study expertise and um, I was already working at TNO at that time. So I did my PhD, um, during my work at TNO. So, you know, it also took took a few years longer than the usual four years that we have in the Netherlands for a PhD. So, um, I started working in 86 at TNO and then, you know, I started doing my PhD thinking about a topic and I wanted to do something with expertise because it was also related to the work I was doing at that time at TNO, which was about, um, knowledge elicitation for expert systems. Um, so I got to think about, well, if I want to study expertise, what area of expertise can I study? And, um, at that time, well, there were maybe one or two projects that I did in in in some fields, but they didn't lend themselves very well for a PhD, I thought. So I thought, well, we have a lot of researchers here at TNO and, you know, all my colleagues, they're all experts in in designing experiments. So, you know, we were still a very kind of traditional, um, institute at that time, you might say. At least, I mean in terms of doing doing experiments, lab experiments. And they they could be either psychology experiments, they but there were also many other, um, fields of expertise and and fields of science involved, like, um, visual perception and auditory perception and thermal physiology and and so stuff like that. But I thought, well, if I can ask all of my colleagues to participate in my experiments, then, you know, I have them all at hand and I can I can do experiments with them. Um, and what I did is I presented them with a particular research question, just on a piece of paper like, um, suppose you want to investigate the effects of A on B, um, how would you do that? How would you design an experiment to test that? And then I had them think aloud. Um, so it was sort of naturalistic decision-making, but it was very much influenced by my experience that I had at Carnegie Melon University, um, just the the year before I started working at TNO, which was very much dominated by the, um, the verbal protocol tradition of of Erikson and Simon and and the thinking aloud, um, method. So, I had all my colleagues think aloud while they designed experiments and the nice thing was because there were so many different disciplines involved that I could give all the participants questions about different disciplines. So I gave a psychology expert also something about, um, audiology, which they, you know, never would have done otherwise. And so I could test whether and what part of their expertise would actually transfer to the different field of research. So, yeah, kind kind of NDM, but not not really a cognitive Well, I did some kind of task analysis, I must say. I I started out one one of the chapters in my PhD thesis was a task analysis of what it means to design an experiment. So in that sense, yes, some early some early NDM kind of research.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, and the other component that feels very NDM uh centric is is you're asking people about, um, um, their their world of work, you know, their their expertise, which is, um, you know, very different from asking school kids to do an artificial memory task.

**Speaker 4:** Oh, yeah, oh yeah, actually the completely true. I mean, you know, this was really their job to to design experiments, to think the only thing is they had to to think aloud. So I did not do like a what you would later call a cognitive task analysis in the sense of being a direct interview. Um, so I was very much relying on on verbal protocols and on analyzing those verbal protocols. That was the main the main vehicle that I used for my PhD thesis.

**Speaker 2:** Sure. And so did you did you say that you were at Carnegie Melon? Did you did you uh work with Herb Simon?

**Speaker 4:** Yes, yes, I did actually. Um, he was he was of course still around there at that time. I took classes with him. Um, so I I must say, you know, he was he's been one of the biggest influences on my my thinking. Um, still is. Um, and so I also took classes with John Anderson and um, we also worked with um, with Marshall Just primarily and and Pat Carpenter. Um, so I did research with Marshall Just on, um, developed computational models of, um, people taking uh intelligence tests. At that time, we studied the Raven progressive matrices as an intelligence test for the for the G, the general intelligence component. And um, so we we tried to develop, um, computational models for how people solve those those problems in that intelligence test. Yeah.

**Speaker 2:** That is so interesting. So I actually I was in Pittsburgh, I was going to pit which is just down the road from Carnegie Melon in 1987, 88. Uh, so we weren't in Pittsburgh at the same time, were we?

**Speaker 4:** No, I was there, um, after just after I finished my master's in psychology and then I went to Pittsburgh in 85 and went back in 86 to start at TNO.

**Speaker 2:** I see. So we just missed each other.

**Speaker 3:** That's Yeah, we just missed each other by by one or two years, right. Right.

**Speaker 4:** But I I I went to pit a couple of times, yeah. Took some classes with um Walter Schneider.

**Speaker 2:** Oh, yeah. Wow. Small world.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, and so, um, I think I met you at the NDM meeting in Dayton in 94. Um, and so I'm wondering how you found your way there. I think you were the only person from TNO who came.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah. I think that's true. Um, the way I I came there actually was that I had heard about, um, Gary Klein, um, through my colleague, um, at TNO, Peter Essen. And Peter Essen at that time was involved, um, in a, I think a one or two NATO research study groups and, um, so I think through his contacts also with Jan Canne Bauwer and and probably others in that field. Um, these were the early days, I think of also of the Tatmus project. Um, he he knew or at least knew the name of Gary Klein. And so we talked about it and he said, well, there is, you know, there's an upcoming conference and and maybe you should contact Gary Klein. So, so I remember emailing Gary with um three suggestions for a paper that I could present during the 1994, um, Dayton conference. One of them being about my my PhD research actually. Um, the other one was on research that I had done for the Navy on, uh, naval damage control. And also at that time, I was working with, um, the river pilots in Rotterdam, um, which was really a task analysis on how they, um, conned the ships in and out of the harbor of Rotterdam. Um, so I made those three suggestions to Gary and I remember him emailing back that I think he found the one on naval damage control the most interesting. And then so I submitted a paper on that. And, um, yeah, that's how it came to be and I went to Dayton to present that paper and it was also published in one of the NDM books coming out of that conference.

**Speaker 2:** Wow. And and since then you have been, uh, kind of one of the proponents of NDM research through your whole career.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah. I've, um, I missed a few, I think, but, um, and it all depends on whether you're, um, whether there is funding available to travel, etc. Um, so, yeah, I've, yeah.

**Speaker 2:** I didn't mean to interrupt you. Sorry. I was just going to say you you actually hosted a meeting which, um, we know is a heroic effort.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, that's right. I I did the one in 2005 in in Amsterdam. Um, yeah, it's um, it's um, it's a lot of effort to do but very rewarding, I think. Um, yeah, slightly, I think what also, you know, was aligned to this and what helped a lot was that I became the the chairman for a NATO group, a NATO research study group on cognitive task analysis around this early time, 94, 95. And one of the members of that group was, um, from the United States, um, was Susan Chipman, um, who was at the office of naval research at that time and of course was a big sponsor for all kinds of cognitive science research. Um, and so we ended up together organizing a meeting, um, in Washington DC on cognitive task analysis in 97. And the book that you mentioned in your introduction, the cognitive task analysis book that was published in 2000, actually came out of that meeting in 97. So it was, I mean, it was slightly separate from the from the NDM tracks, but but many of the researchers who were also at NDM, um, presenting work on on cognitive task analysis also were at that meeting in 97 in Washington DC. Uh, not just the regular NDM bunch, but there was also like other researchers that would not otherwise maybe attend, um, NDM conferences such as, um, well, Kim Vicenta was there for one. Um, he presented one of his later chapters on on his cognitive work analysis book. Earl Hunt was there, um, so many other people.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, that's been a very influential book. That that was an amazing project that you brought all those people together with different perspectives to to write about this this topic that I I feel like at that time people were just kind of figuring out what do we mean by cognitive task analysis? What is cognitive task analysis and what is not cognitive task analysis? Um, and so that that book was very influential.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. And so it dated I think, you know, the work we did with with the NATO research study group and um, dated back to, as I said, to the mid 90s and there wasn't a whole lot around at that time. Um, so we we did a lot of study literature study on what was around and I I seem to remember, I, you know, I don't ask me exactly about the the dates of the the papers at this moment, but I think the term probably dates back to the, well, mid 80s. You you you you would probably know better than I do. But, um, so, you know, certainly the work by by Emily Roth and David Woods were probably some of the first instances in which it was actually used and mentioned. Um, but so in the mid 90s, there was not a whole lot of tradition at that time in in cognitive task analysis. And there were also very, very different traditions. So, actually, there was like the more cognitive systems engineering tradition, um, also represented by David Woods or by by Kim Vicenta, for instance, um, uh, there was the tradition also by, um, the cognitive modeling tradition with which Susan Chipman, of course, was more familiar, um, because she funded a lot of research by people like David Kiras, for instance, who also was at the Washington meeting. Um, and so also from that tradition, there were some people, um, using the term cognitive, um, task analysis, um, because actually in order to understand what people are doing and how they solve problems in that problem-solving tradition, you also need to know their their problem space. And so cognitive task analysis was a way of, um, describing the problem space. Actually, I mean this goes back to the work by Noel and Simon, which they did in in human problem-solving in 72, um, which actually, you know, describes, um, how to how to develop and describe those problem spaces. So that was like a very early early sort of cognitive task analysis. And then, of course, there was the third tradition, which probably had, you know, well, it had started with Gary Klein, of course, doing his research, um, in the mid 80s on the firefighters and, um, and so, yeah, I think those three traditions came together during that Dayton, or sorry, during that Washington DC meeting in which we organized, um, around our NATO group.

**Speaker 3:** So, Ya Martina, kind of listen to you, um, talk about methods and interviewing and and also listening to the project you mentioned earlier about damage control. But I'm also thinking about those kids that you made cry, um, back in the early days. And it's it's kind of I'm starting to wonder if if you might have a perception on or experience with or or suggestions about, you know, we we we often talk about these task analysis and work analysis methods and uh and solving problems and decision-making, but the fact of the matter is a lot of us have worked with and worked in domains, worked with experts in domains where they're dealing with life and death situations, very personally traumatic incidents that they're trying to recall. I'm wondering if you've had any experience, um, you mentioned the damage control, that that certainly could be a domain where, uh, the recall of of of traumatic events might find its way into the interview, uh, and and and just you have any experience with folks who have who have gotten emotional or who uh in their retelling of of incidents have, uh, you know, not really been able to focus or, uh, I'm just wondering because you had that early experience with the kids crying and you sort of just changed paths, but you can't really do that in an interview, right? You you you're sort of there and and the conversation needs to go forward. Have you had any experiences like that? And do you have any suggestions for people about how to handle those kinds of interviews?

**Speaker 4:** Not a whole lot, I must say. Um, I'm no, I mean, the damage control at that time, um, that was, you know, that that was really kind of kind of early. Um, so the the experience, the actual experience that the damage control officers had was was kind of limited. Um, we know of course, I mean, later when I was in 2000, when I was at the Naval Air Warfare Center in Orlando, um, we of course had the the bombing of the, um, the USS Cole, which was like an early attack by Al-Qaeda on on a naval warship. And so that's an, you know, kind of an instance of of the ensuing damage control, but of course, I didn't interview those people, but I can imagine there would be traumatic, um, experiences there.

**Speaker 3:** Right.

**Speaker 4:** Um, I I don't recall that many really traumatic, um, incidents to be honest in during interviews. No.

**Speaker 3:** Right. Yeah, I I don't think, you know, depending on what domain you're working in, you're going to see more or less of this, but, um, I I I do think that's something our community can talk a bit more about, um, and just, you know, be open about and maybe give some younger researchers guidance, um, for that sort of thing. So and you and you work with younger researchers, uh, in a variety of capacities. Um, and so I'm wondering is that something that you address with them or, uh, is that something that you, uh, purposefully try to get them to think about before they're heading into, uh, their field work?

**Speaker 4:** Um, yeah, sure. I mean, um, interviewing techniques are important. Um, and so I I teach a class particularly for more, um, technically oriented students. Um, in a in in in it's called interaction technology. It's a master in interaction technology. And one of the classes that I teach there is on various techniques for for doing user centered design kind of studies. And of course, interviewing is one is one of the aspects in that. So it's not necessarily related to, um, to experts or maybe naturalistic decision-making per se, but at least, um, interviewing techniques are important in in general also for those kinds of, um, for those kinds of students. Um, I do, well, I do remember now that I thought about it a little bit more, um, we did a project once on on fratricide. Um, so, uh, shooting, shooting your own people, um, and we we did interviews, but we actually outsourced the actual interviewing, um, because, um, they were interviews with veterans from from a long time ago. So, um, veterans that fought in Indonesia actually just after the Second World War for for the Dutch, uh, forces then. And, um, we had access to them, but only through other people who were, you know, allowed to and to interview them. So, but we we did set up an interview protocol and we did but together with anthropologists sort of devised a way of, um, reliving those memories again, um, in a kind of vivid fashion, but of course not I mean not too, not too vivid that it would be, um, traumatic. Uh, but so, yeah, there are certain techniques that we, that we came up with like, um, imagining certain sounds or or smells or or the kinds of clothes that you wore at that time or, so bringing people back into an actual situation, um, would help them relive those those those memories of of shooting, you know, their their fellow soldiers. And so, yeah, we got some extensive interviews out of that.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, I bet. So so so the technique was to, uh, sort of introduce a, uh, a sensory experience as a way to help the recall, is that was that the idea?

**Speaker 4:** Yes, yes, as a way because because it was of course a long time ago for them. Um, I when was it? Well, it must have well, at least, well, no, I mean, it must have been 60 years ago or something. So, I mean, these people were, of course, in their 70s, 80s. Um, and then you try to recall something like 60 years ago. So, um, it's an interesting aspect of, you know, what is called like, um, the the the critical event, um, interview or it's a critical event, but it's a one that is a long time ago. So you need to sort of bring people back into their right state of mind to to get those memories back and and also of course in a valid fashion as far as possible, which is a challenge in itself.

**Speaker 3:** Very interesting. So Jan Martin, what's the most exciting project you're working on right now?

**Speaker 4:** We do a project for the for the Dutch Navy, um, that is on rotational crewing concepts. It's something that the US Navy has, um, also experience with and has experimented with. Um, so it actually means that you decouple the crew from the actual ship they're on. And so you can have a particular ship longer out in a mission area, and then the crew rotates back and forth, and so different crews rotate across that single ship. So the advantage is that you can have that ship in the mission area for longer, for longer periods of time without that particular ship having to sail back, um, to the to the harbor, um, and then another ship having to sail back into the mission area. So it that's an exciting project, um, because, um, of course, you need you need to talk to to experts, um, about that, but there are very few experts in the sense that, um, not a whole lot of experience has been, um, gained with that yet. Um, but it's, um, it's it's exciting because it involves all different aspects of of what the Navy is doing. I mean, it it has implications for almost their entire way of operating. It has implications for for training. So for instance, if you would have a full warship trainer in which you can train a lot of the things that you would otherwise do on a ship, um, then you would have more ships available, um, than if you would not have a trainer like that. And if you have more ships available, then it's easier to have more ships out in the mission area. So we're actually going, you know, all the way down to, um, to devising certain certain schemes and plans in time of if you have four vessels in a particular class, when and where would what particular vessel be, and where would each crew be, and what would they be doing? Would they be at home, recuperating, would they be training, would they be, um, on the ship, would they they be doing maintenance. So there are all kinds of new maintenance concepts that have to be taken into account here. So it actually, if you move in that direction, it has an impact on on the entire way of working of a of a Navy. So that's, you know, that's a very exciting project that I that I work on right now.

**Speaker 2:** There are so many interesting pieces of that. I was thinking, um, just the idea of rotating crews in and out. Do you do you rotate out the entire crew or a few crew members at a time? Uh, because there must be some sort of cost in terms of handoff and, you know, knowledge of of what's going on now. Um,

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, exactly. Yes, yeah. So all these kinds of questions come into play. Um, so how do you how would you do the handover? It's called handover takeover. Um, it's the term they use, but so if if one if if there is a crew coming onto the ship and there is a crew leaving, you would need to have some kind of handover takeover. Um, actually what what we're thinking about now is that it, you know, would be best to change the the entire crew rather than than part of the crew in order to, um, maintain a kind of team, team cohesion and team integrity and also some kind of shared mental models. So, in terms you have all these all these team concepts and cognitive concepts playing a role here in this new kind of of design. And also issues of ownership, for instance, um, one of the things, you know, they always tell us is, yeah, it's like having a rental car from a company and if you leave it behind messy, then the next one will also leave it behind even more messy. But if you take care of your rental car and you fill it up and you clean it out, if you hand it in, then the next person will probably also be likely to do the same. Um, or not or not. Um, they may think, well, that's that's nice. Thank you. But, um, so, all these kinds of things of like do they still feel a sense of ownership for a ship if they are not part of that ship, if they part of their identity is, I'm a member of that, I'm a crew of that ship, uh, and now that's not the case anymore. They're just belonging together, um, as a as a team, but the ship they're actually going to is different.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, so many so many interesting layers to that. That is fascinating work.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, right. So, um, and also it has implications for the ship design. So, for instance, um, if those ships are slightly different, um, that of course makes it harder to take over or to switch among ships. Um, of course, I mean, ships are not being built at the same time. They come into existence like maybe a couple of years apart and then with mid-life upkeeps, etc. Um, software is being, um, upgraded and so the ships don't necessarily have the same kind of, um, software upgrades or or equipment and one ship could be ahead of the other, and that makes it difficult and more challenging for crews to to switch across ships. So, um, there is an a requirement also for the design of, uh, for ships to be as similar as possible. That's also one of the things, uh, that we learned.

**Speaker 2:** Sure, that makes sense. And even if they are very similar, it just it seems like if this is your ship, you know all of its quirks, all of the little, uh, you know, anomalies about that particular ship and how it operates. And and if you're moving from from ship to ship, you may not have that kind of deep knowledge about the technology you're interacting with.

**Speaker 4:** Yes, yes, exactly. And and of course, I mean, every ship has its has its quirks then and but then you would have to hand that over as part of the kind of transition phase to the other crew, you would have to tell them, of course, um, what is wrong with that particular ship at that particular time, if anything is wrong or what the particular quirks are. But these these concepts are not new, of course. I mean, in in we have the same kind of issue in medical teams with handovers. Um, we have the same kind of issue in in industry, when you have different crews taking over from each other in shifts. Um, I was at a steel factory once where, um, they said, well, you know, the second crew they would take over from the first crew and they would say, well, as soon as we take over, we will just reset everything and we will just start again and work with our own settings because that's that's the way we do things here. That's the that's the way we're used to things. So they would change settings, um, for instance, um, of course, many times it's not possible, but, um, and and we also know know from accident research that many things go wrong precisely at those handover moments, for instance, in in shipping, in in merchant marine shipping, for instance, um, if you change every four hours or every six hours, it's very important to do a good handover there as well. And if you if you're tired, um, you don't tell everything properly, uh, you know, things are bound to go wrong. So, there are many aspects in cognitive engineering and and human factors engineering that that play a role they in this particular project as well.

**Speaker 2:** Absolutely, that sounds fascinating. So I wonder, um, looking forward if, um, if there are, um, uh, particular goals or directions you're hoping to take your work.

**Speaker 4:** So for like, um, like, um, future work, um, yeah, um, so I work a lot with, um, I mean, both at the University of Tente with PhD students, also, of course, master students or bachelor students, but PhD students, of course, sort of give you the advantage of of doing somewhat longer term research and so I have two PhD students that recently started. Um, so these are two areas that I will be working on in the coming year in the coming years. And the first one, um, with Lida David, um, is continuing work that I did over the past few years on changes in team communication patterns in novel or demanding situations and that also entails ways to automatically record team communication patterns and ways to provide feedback to teams about the way they communicate. And a second uh PhD project that I've just started with Serena Durstein is developing resilient complex cyber physical systems that are equipped to keep supporting and collaborating with humans throughout the changes that the fourth industrial revolution will enable. So we will do cognitive field studies in, for instance, the car manufacturing industry to see how implementation of cyber physical systems takes place over time there. Um, and cyber physical systems are net are a kind of a network system in which data and information are constantly exchanged and algorithms influence and determine both machine and human behavior. So, um, those are two lines of research that I will pursue in the next four years. Um, I'm also conducting research on collaboration at a distance, for instance, troubleshooting on naval ships, how to do that from ashore. Um, of course, that also relates back to that rotational crewing uh project that I just talked about. Because if a particular ship is further, um, out in the mission area and you can't return to your naval base, you need to do more troubleshooting on the ship itself or you would have to fly in maintenance crews, of course. Um, I also do research on supporting multi-team systems, collaborating with various, um, automated systems, uh, research on semi-automated driving and how to explain the car's actions to the driver. So that's on explainability and transparency of automated systems. And, uh, I will also be doing research on supporting cyber security professionals in banks in dealing with malicious cyber attacks. So, actually quite a broad range of of projects that I'll be working on in the next year or, you know, four years in case of of the PhD projects.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, these are all very kind of big societal issues. Um, I the phrase you used uh complex cyber physical systems, I am not familiar with that. So you said these are networked systems and then you offered cars and example as an example. Can you tell me more about uh, yeah, what what is a cyber physical system?

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, well, um, so it allows you to to exchange, um, data and information much more, um, than you do now. So, um, that's the the cyber part is to, I mean, it's called cyber, but it doesn't have so much to do with, um, cyber security as well as that it it introduces, um, network systems and algorithms in traditional, um, car manufacturing, uh, industries, which is called the the industry 4.0, uh, revolution. Um, but it allows also the operators to work more with data and information and and be more aware of, um, of what is going on and also to give them more authority to, um, make decisions quicker. And so, I mean, you can it's it's it's it's a form of, of course, of of human machine teaming on human machine collaboration. Um, but these ideas in these traditional kind of industries are quite new and they haven't been implemented widely. So, um, that's going to be a challenge and and what we're what we want to do in this project is to see if they're introducing that, how how does that work over time? How does how what are the best ways to introduce these, um, these systems into their industry. And so that's what my PhD student wants to wants to investigate using concepts from cognitive systems engineering, etc. But in these kinds of industries, they are very very new concepts. So, I think we, you know, we we can do a lot of new things there.

**Speaker 2:** Very interesting.

**Speaker 3:** So, I'm wondering just to pull that thread a bit, are are there domains or maybe even customers where you think an NDM perspective might be quite useful but you've you've kind of struggled to get traction to get other people excited about, uh, what this kind of perspective can bring.

**Speaker 4:** That's a good question, um, because, you know, a lot of the work that we do at TNO actually lends itself very well to an NDM perspective. Um, so I've been involved in many in many different areas, um, varying from from from the Navy, the army, uh, to to medicine, medical teamwork, um, to to the police or the the firefighters, um, to harbor pilots, to, um, that work with forensic, um, analysts. Um, so there are just so many areas and I think I've always, you know, been successful in in convincing people, um, well, not so much of of the value of NDM because, um, you know, they as customers, they they trust that you have the right methods, um, and so I don't need to convince them really of the value of of NDM as such. Um, I need to convince them that I will, um, bring them something that that they need or, you know, to to solve their problem. Uh, and yeah, so it it it has not always been not always worked, um, as as maybe as well as I would have hoped, uh, in all cases, but in many different areas, people are sort of quite receptive, I think, to an NDM kind of approach because it it respects, um, the experts, it shows respect for the experts, and as long as you do that, then people are are willing to go to go along with you. Um, I remember, well, one project, um, but that sort of proves the point in an opposite way is that with the harbor pilots in Rotterdam, um, that was in the early 90s. So I was I was kind of young and trying out various things as well then, I think. But, um, we used a lot of different techniques and one of them was to go with the the harbor pilots on board of the ships and, you know, I had them again, I had them think aloud. So I stripped them to, um, a cassette, uh, tape recorder and I had them think aloud all the time, which that worked perfectly all right. Um, but then I also wanted to have them do some, um, limited information tasks or or I think I was influenced by a particular paper by Robert Hoffman at at that time or a constrained information, uh, task. Um, and so I had like 10 or 15 pilots come to their main office on a particular day and I think they had even had to take some free time for that and then I presented them all kinds of sort of constraint information, uh, tasks. Um, so for instance, I showed them video. I had also taken video from the bridge of the ship, um, from a particular perspective and I showed them video and then also had them do particular things, think aloud or do other kinds of, um, strange stuff. And I remember many of them just violently opposing these very strange in their eyes tasks that I gave them and and they, you know, almost at the point of refusing to cooperate with me. Um, so that was a that was kind of a painful experience, um, I must say that, um, but it's kind of it proves the point that as if if I mean, interviewing is very accepted and having people think aloud is not that difficult. But if you bring them out of their comfort zone, if you have them do things that are unnatural to them, then they then they get really, um, um, well, reluctant to to cooperate. That's what I experienced, um, a couple of times.

**Speaker 3:** That is a great story and a great point.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, so it's it's not to say you should never do, um, limited information tasks again. Um, I don't think that that's the the moral of the story per se, but you, I should probably in retrospect have introduced it better to them and I think that would have solved some of the problems. Um, but I as I said, I was quite young at that time and, um, well, you learn from your mistakes.

**Speaker 2:** Sure. I mean, I feel like every interview I've ever done when I read the transcript, I'm saying to myself, why didn't I ask this followup question? Um, almost every data collection I've done afterwards, I can think of how I might have done it a little better.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

**Speaker 2:** That's the nature of this work, yeah. So, I'm wondering, I know you've worked in a lot of different, uh, domains, but if you think back over your career, which project has been the most rewarding to you?

**Speaker 4:** Um, yeah, um, that that's undoubtedly a project on, uh, structured troubleshooting that I did in the 90s and that was also for the for the Dutch Navy, by the way. That was a very rewarding project and I think one of the most successful ones, um, that I did, um, ever. It started out in the early 90s with the Navy being interested in applications of knowledge-based systems, um, uh, so, where have we heard that before, right? Um, artificial intelligence these days. But at, I mean, it's not a new thing. Um, I was working on expert systems and artificial intelligence in by the late 80s and early 90s a lot. And and so also the Navy they started out, well, maybe by by asking, well, what what potential benefit is there from by from knowledge-based systems in in trying to troubleshoot. But then it moved very quickly to another question and that had to do with, um, training troubleshooting by, um, corporals in in the Navy. So, um, and our project officer that we had at that time moved from one particular place to the to the school where they trained and, um, he had known us from our work in in knowledge-based systems and and now he was interested in improving the education of troubleshooting. Because the Navy noticed that when those people, the corporals who had just taken a particular class in troubleshooting in a particular system. So, I mean, there are like dozens of courses, each particular system has its own course. Um, they noticed that when they came to the ship, their efficiency in troubleshooting was actually quite low. Um, so they could solve very few problems or at least not as many as they had hoped they would be able to. So, they came to us and asked, well, can you improve the the education and the courses that we have in troubleshooting? And there were a couple of of things to consider. One is to, um, of course, improve the the efficiency and effectiveness. Well, at least and first of all, the effectiveness of troubleshooting. But secondly, also the efficiency in the sense of can you train them faster? Um, can you train them in less time? Um, so that became a challenge. I mean, so the the the question now was, can we arrive at better troubleshooting results in less time? And so and if so, how would you do that? So, we worked for like many years, um, until about the late 90s. So, almost for eight years, I think in a series of projects, um, we innovated their training and we came up with different approaches, was a completely different approach to how to train troubleshooting. And, um, it was it was based on two ideas. Um, we observed expert troubleshooters, we observed novices. We noticed the differences between the two. We noticed that the experts had a structured approach to troubleshooting, and we also noticed that the experts had mental representations of the system that they were troubleshooting in at various levels of abstraction, which the novices didn't have. So, we thought that both elements were important, both the structured approach as well as the, um, the nature of the representations at various levels of abstraction. And we developed new kinds of representations for for various systems. They weren't there. I mean, they had particular representations, but they were at very low levels of detail as delivered by the the companies that had, um, designed and and engineered the systems. So, I mean, they have company kind of documentation with the systems, but they're at a very low level. So, not very helpful for for troubleshooters. Um, and so we had to develop these kinds of intermediate level representations, um, for, um, functional representations for the troubleshooters. I mean, if I had read at that time, I must say in retrospect the work of Rasmusen a little better than I did, um, I would have made some more progress, I think, because what we really did, I think in hindsight, is kind of reinvent the abstraction hierarchy that Rasmusen had already developed also in for troubleshooting, but anyway. Um, but we added the structured approach to troubleshooting and so we trained both. And so we, what we also did was we conducted controlled experiments in which we, um, could demonstrate to the Navy that with the new approach that we had developed and which we actually implemented in classes, uh, so the students that came out of those classes, um, that contained our new approach, then actually solved almost twice as many problems, um, compared to students that took the old classes, the old approach to troubleshooting. So, it went up from 45% to about 90% correct. And also, um, as a result of of the way we structured the classes, um, they could do it with like a third less in time. So about in in about two-thirds of the time that they originally took. So the Navy took up that approach and sort of reorganized their entire engineering education, all the all the classes that they taught, um, at their schools were being reorganized according to the concepts that we had developed. So I think in, you know, that's that's one of the most successful projects that we ever did.

**Speaker 2:** There are so many amazing things about that project you described. Um, but one one thing I'm latching onto because I'm struggling with this in some of my work right now is that you were able to do a really effective evaluation. I think in in terms of of assessing the impact of training, it's really, really hard to do in so many domains. Um, and and lots of times people, um, the most you're able to do is is is get a sense from the instructors and the students that it feels worthwhile and they're more confident. But you were actually able to show some changes in performance.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, def definitely. And of course, we were very lucky because I mean, we could have many, um, many, many naval students as it was our participants. Um, but they were really, I mean, really, um, good kind of of of simulations of their actual work. Um, so they were not laboratory serial kind of troubleshooting tasks. What we actually did the Navy at that time had all their systems, they had duplicates off on on the shore in the school of the actual systems. So what we did was we planted faults in the actual system, then had, um, a participant come and we just said to them, well, you know, he's standing in front of a computer, for instance, this is the computer, there is something wrong. Someone from the operational services now has said to you it doesn't work anymore. So go and find go and troubleshoot. And then we had them think aloud and we recorded every step they took and like it took about an hour, we gave them an hour for each of the problems that we gave them. So four problems, four hours in total. And we had think aloud protocols and we also had some assessment of their knowledge through knowledge tests that we gave them. And so it was a very comprehensive kind of evaluation. Yes, with with sufficient numbers of participants. And I think that was really, um, influential also in changing the Navy's opinion because, you know, we could really demonstrate with data that our approach were better than the original existing approach.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, that's an amazing project. So, Ya Martin, you you've sort of touched on a bunch of uh sister disciplines to NDM. I'm wondering if we could get you to think about if you if you meet a perfect stranger, uh, that you've never, uh, spoken with, but they claim to practice NDM. Uh, I'm wondering if if you could give them one question, uh, to find out if they do indeed practice NDM, what would you ask?

**Speaker 4:** Yes, I would, I would ask, do you respect the authenticity of what your practitioner is telling you? I think that would sum up, um, you know, what they would be doing NDM because, um, well, first of all, of course, I'm assuming there is a practitioner. So, like an expert, um, that is actually the the object of your study. Um, but I think it's really about respecting authenticity. It's respecting what, um, what the practitioner is is telling you. So it is also, um, it would also include, um, respect for, um, for cognitive task analysis, respect for introspection, what people tell you. Um, not distrusting that straight away. Um, so respecting authenticity of what practitioners are telling you would be would be my kind of, yeah, sort of touchstone of of whether they would be doing real NDM.

**Speaker 3:** Excellent answer.

**Speaker 2:** That is a great response. All right, so we have one last question. I'm going to ask you to tell us two truths about yourself and one lie and then both Brian and I are going to try to guess which one is the lie.

**Speaker 4:** Okay. So the first one, I met my future wife during a show jumping contest in which we both participated with our horses. Needless to say, she won while I came in third.

**Speaker 3:** Wait, what part of that might be the lie? Is it that you met or that you came in third?

**Speaker 4:** That's up to you. So, the second one, um, my wife and I called our first pet, which was a guinea pig, Big Big Track. And it was named after a small robotic programmable device that was used for experimental purposes at Carnegie Melon University during our state area in 1985, 1986. And the third one, I ran my first ultra marathon, the Eiger trail in the Swiss Alps, when I was well in my 50s.

**Speaker 3:** This is the most complex set we've ever had on this program.

**Speaker 2:** It's so true. Are you going to go first, Brian, or you want me to?

**Speaker 3:** Um, I am because I do not believe the guinea pig story. There's just way too many details there.

**Speaker 2:** I, uh, I don't believe the show jumping contest story.

**Speaker 4:** Okay. Can you tell me why? Laura?

**Speaker 2:** Um, no, I'm just guessing. I mean, it's completely believable to me that you did an ultra marathon. Yes. And it's also, you seem nerdy enough to name a pet after a a piece of technology. I I could see that.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, you're right, Laura. So the the first one is not is not correct. Although we we did do, um, we did do horse riding, not show jumping though, but dressage. Um, but I didn't meet my my future wife during show jumping, during horse riding. I I met her actually during uh our psychology study. So that was not that was not correct. Uh Brian, the big track thing, it's true enough. There was a device called Big track at Carnegie Melon and they did experiments with that. And it's even published in cognitive science, I think. Um, so and we called our first pet after Big track because my fa my wife was was also with me during uh our stay in Cornegie Melon.

**Speaker 3:** Fantastic. I am terrible at this game, but uh these are bringing out great stories from people.

**Speaker 2:** They are. Yeah, so thank you Jan Martin for speaking with us today. It has been so nice to talk with you.

**Speaker 4:** Thank you.
