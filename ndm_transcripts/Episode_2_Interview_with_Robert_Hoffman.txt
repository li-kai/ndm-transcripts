Okay, here is the transcription of the podcast with speaker diarization:

**Speaker 1**
The Naturalistic Decision Making podcast with Brian Moon and Laura Millatello. This podcast series brings you interviews with leading NDM researchers who study and support people who make decisions under stress.

**Speaker 4**
Welcome to the Naturalistic Decision Making Podcast. This is Brian Moon from Paragon Technologies.

**Speaker 5**
And this is Laura Millatello from Applied Decision Science.

**Speaker 4**
Today we welcome our friend Robert Hoffman. Robert is a luminary in the NDM community, a widely recognized world leader in cognitive Systems engineering and Human Centered computing. He's a senior member and fellow of numerous International Science and Engineering societies. Since 1999, he has called the Institute for Human Machine Cognition his organizational home. And he organized the NDM 6 conference in 2003 in his hometown of Pensacola, Florida. He has co-authored and co-edited 18 scholarly books including two with your hosts, and has co-author on over 100 publications in peer-reviewed journals. For 20 years, he served as co-editor for the Department of Human Center Computing in IEEE Intelligence Systems. He was a co-founder of the Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making, a major publication outlet for NDM research. Welcome Robert, and thank you for joining us.

**Speaker 3**
Thank you for inviting me.

**Speaker 4**
Our first question gets us focused on uh or the early part of your career and we're wondering if you can remember the first paper you published and what it was about.

**Speaker 3**
That was when I was in my first days in graduate school. Um there were two of them, um 1976-ish. Uh, one was a paper on umnic imagery and the bizarre so-called bizarre effect. Um, I've been working for some while with uh one of the professors there, Joel uh Joel Setter, Joe Setter, who um uh was my mentor in many ways. I took intro psych from him and uh that's what turned me on to psychology and he was studying uh pneumonic memory, that is relying on mental imagery as a memory technique. and um, we were all very keen on the bizarreness hypothesis, which was that if you form associative images that are particularly bizarre, that they are therefore particularly memorable. And we did a number of studies trying various kinds of control conditions to try and find a bizarreness effect and and I think we did. Um, although other studies weren't quite as successful as ours and that was that was um one of my first publications. Uh, the other one was a history piece. I I became interested at about the same time in um, the question of the origins of the so-called psycholinguistic revolution. This was in the 70s where people were getting uh excited by uh a number of things including um Chomsky and uh the the the people beating up on Skinner and and the behaviorists and and all of that. and this this was before it became cognitive psychology. This was before it became cognitive science. Uh, mentalism was still taboo uh in many ways and certainly in many academic psychology departments and people were riding high on Thomas Cohn and arguing that there was a psycholinguistic revolution going on and I thought I always believed that the work that had been done on mental imagery and pneumonics in particular was part of the mix of of motivating some people uh to champion what would soon become cognitive psychology. So, uh I got on a bus and I went up to Cornell and I interviewed Nicer, um, I had an opportunity subsequently to interview George Miller, spent some time with both of them and uh they were clearly influenced by uh the work that had been done on pneumonic techniques. And so I wrote up a little historical piece on the origins of the psycholinguistic revolution and that was that may have been my first publication, maybe the pneumonics paper was, I I'd have to go back and look at my Vita, but that that goes way back to uh the the dark ages when uh psychology was just escaping from behaviorism. Unfortunately, psychology is still suffering a lingering hangover from behaviorism but relying on voodo voodoo concepts like the distinction between subjective and objective data and and all kinds of other things that that still have me concerned to this day. So that historical activity or that activity way back in my history has its its lingering impression.

**Speaker 4**
That's great. So, uh given your background in experimental psychology, I'm I'm kind of wondering if you could share with us uh how you made the turn if you will to NDM or maybe making a turn to NDM isn't the right way to think about uh sort of where your um interests and career went after your early work and experimental psychology. Can you kind of help us understand how you how you made that turn?

**Speaker 3**
Well, it wasn't really uh a turn directly to NDM. um, at the time that I was um metamorphosing. Uh NDM per se hadn't started to exist yet. Uh there were two uh key events. One was I started to become dissatisfied with the uh academic paradigm of psycholinguistics that had been developed on the heels of the study of verbal behavior including some dissatisfaction with my own research that involved presenting people sentence after sentence after sentence and giving them some sort of judgment task or whatever and then doing recall or recognition tasks, that sort of thing. And after a while, I mean I thought I got some interesting results about psychosmantics but um, it just didn't seem right that that we'd be reaching conclusions about how people understand and work with language by giving them these kinds of artificial laboratory uh tasks. And for a long time I had wanted to uh to work with Jim Jenkins. In fact, um after I finished my undergraduate work, I wanted to go to Minnesota. But I only got sort of high B level on my GREs and I really at that point wasn't sure what I was going to do. I almost uh continued the path of of becoming a professional musician. Um but then I got accepted into graduate school at the University of Cincinnati. They had a they had a and I will answer your question. They had a they had a grant that allowed them to um fund graduate students. And they'd reached a point in that particular year where they had made a bunch of offers to people and had gotten turned down by people who had decided to go elsewhere. So they had these slots and they had to fill them. So they dipped into their own undergraduate pool and asked me if I'd want to go there. And I thought, well, sure. And so I went there specifically with the idea of working with Dickc, which was uh great fun and eminently rewarding. Um But then along the way, I encountered the work of Jim Jenkins and thought it was really very, very good and he had been a colleague with one of my mentors, Bill Denver and came to the uh came to UC, gave a talk and all of that. And I had coincidentally, uh and I forget how I learned about it. I had been turned on to a book by a California psychologist named Stephen Pepper. It was called world hypothesis. Um, probably the most important book I've ever I've ever read. Um, I think one of the most important books in in philosophy, philosophy, psychology ever. And in that book, Pepper talked about a number of world hypotheses. These are grand metaphorical world views. you can see the world as being composed of mechanisms. You can see it uh composed of of rules and logic. Uh you can see it from an organic metaphor or you can see it from what Pepper called a contexlist point of view. Uh and and he provided some very succinct and clear arguments for and against these different uh world views and also showed ways in which they could sometimes resonate together. Uh so Gibson for example, is uh is a form metaphor but also resonates with mechanism in some ways and behavioral views tend to resonate more with with uh certain world views than others and all this interesting combinatorics and contextualism the basic ontology is everything is an event. Everything is an event. Uh, the table in front of me is an event just on a different scale than ordinary human activity. Um, and I thought that made great sense and Pepper's uh discourse on contextualism was very, very influential because it placed an emphasis on uh looking out there at the world of events uh and trying to understand them uh at at that level. Coincidentally, uh, I was getting interested in the work of Franz Brentano, uh, who I believe was uh had an event ontology himself and um, he talked a lot about um, mental representation and presentations using a theatrical metaphor. that consciousness is sort of uh in the audience watching the play of events out in the world in front of it, uh or on stage playing a role. pretty rich metaphor for understanding uh existence broadly speaking. And um, at the University of Minnesota was Burnham Terrell, who was was one of the world leading scholars of Brentano, and Jim Jenkins was at the University of Minnesota. So I thought, I'll go to UC and get my master's degree and and and maybe try and switch over to Minnesota and work with Jenkins because he too had been very much influenced by Pepper's book on contextualism. Um and then uh Nixon ran into trouble, uh Kent State, all these things happened and I figured, well, I'd better get my PhD and get the hell out and then I'll try and go to Minnesota on a post doc and that's eventually the way it unfolded. So Minnesota had had I think I guess it still has a history of of applied researcher, a practical kind of orientation. Uh and that too uh was was part of part of Jim's spirit. So these things came together, the influence of of Pepper, uh Brentano, Burnham Terrell, uh also at Minnesota Paul Meal and a lot of intercourse and and a couple of seminars with Paul Meal. Um, and that all sort of led me in a in a more or less applied direction. Uh coincidentally, the Christmas uh of of when I started at at Minnesota, I went to visit an old physics physicist friend of mine. He had been part of a of a group of radicals, well, quote andunquote radicals, uh back in our hippie days at the at the University of Cincinnati and was a very dear friend, still is to this day. And I went to visit him at his laboratory in Indiana, and walked into his lab and he was hunched over a computer screen looking at this crazy patchwork quilt of colors. I said, what's that? He said, well, this is an aerial thermogram taken from a plane flying at about, I don't know what it was, 4,000 feet, 5,000 feet, something. Uh looking for buildings that needed better insulation. This was in the days of the first energy crunch. And so with these infrared photographs they were able to identify buildings that needed better insulation. I looked at it and the crazy colors and I I said, well, is this is this green blob here, is that a tree? He said, no, no, no, that's that's a building with good insulation. Uh, and so is this is this yellow blob a building with poor insulation? He said, no, that's a tree. Trees are about the warmest thing around in winter time infrared photography. I said, how how was it decided how to code the different temperatures and the different colors? He scratched his head. scratched his head for minutes and didn't didn't really know. It turns out it was a color coding scheme developed by NASA. And at that moment I had this insight that here was this whole new field, then new field of satellite remote sensing where computer people were generating all these beautiful displays, the Landsat images which had false colored gorgeous photographs uh of various Spectra of the Earth and very, very beautiful and I love beautiful things and this involves satellites and outer space and I've always been a science fiction fan. So I thought, well if I could combine what I know in experimental psychology/human factors and and apply it to this domain that that might be an interesting thing to do. So I started to do experiments on how uh experts uh and novice interpret remote sensing uh imagery and uh did some of that while I was at Minnesota. Uh and so I started to move more away from the traditional academic laboratory paradigms into something more applied, started to think about uh the cognition of experts. And uh it was just about that time I think that NDM was was about to start. got into a discussion with Gary Klein about the role of analogy and problem solving. This was before the first NDM meeting. Uh and so I was already moving in that sort of of direction uh for for quite some years. Long answer to a good question.

**Speaker 4**
It was a fascinating answer. Uh, I I I have just a quick followup. Uh back to your moments of delusion uh in you said, uh the the paradigms but also your own research, I wonder if you could share a story or or a moment that was uh particularly troubling, uh where you started to realize this is not what I want to do or this is not the direction I want to go in.

**Speaker 3**
Hmm, it's a good question. Um, I I didn't have a very good time um at the uh at the meeting of the psychonomics Society that I went to. I presented a study um a mental imagery study that I had done with uh with Joe Setter. And at that at that particular time, there was a whole bunch of of stuff getting published about mental representation. Zen and Pishen and a whole bunch of other philosophically inclined people were were waxing eloquent about mental representation and is it propositional or is it logical and all that. and I thought it was um a good example of of why the best thing philosophy can do for science is leave it alone. Uh and um presented um what was a very, very mentalistic paper uh about mental imagery and its role in in in memory and expressed uh the hypothesis that uh it was something that Deconinic called the conceptual base hypothesis. And um, the response to that was was not kind. Uh and I never went back to psychonomics again. Uh, I I can't say in hindsight that it was unprofessional. I think it was probably a good question to ask. Uh, why did I, you know, believe the things that I believe? Uh but it was just uh just a kind of an unkind way. And then, you know, the traditional paradigm and in the study of verbal behavior in psycholinguistics looking at word association frequencies and and all of that and nobody was really hammering very hard on the question of of what's meaning. Um and I thought that the study of uh proverbs, comprehension of proverbs and metaphors was a fascinating way of of thinking about language understanding and meaning understanding generally. And uh had an opportunity to have a chat with Charles Ogood. And uh he recounted a little bit of his background where he said, well, when I was in graduate school, I became interested in the in the question of meaning and so I packed up everything I could and and went on a post doc and I was about to do the same thing. uh to to go to Minnesota. So it's just um, it it was a a zgeist thing and no one particular um, event stands out. Um, I I'd have to think about that a little bit more. It was it was a zgeist.

**Speaker 5**
Nice. So, so Robert, I wanted to ask you, um kind of fast forward in time. I'm to today and I'm wondering what um, what research directions are you most excited about now?

**Speaker 3**
The same one I've been excited about for about the past 10 years, which is to finalize the unified theory of macrocognitive work systems. All of the key components are in place, it's just a matter of sitting down and having the time to write it out. Um, it fundamentally what it is is is putting together uh a lot of the goo that Dave Woods has thrown at the world and a lot of the goo that Gary Klein has thrown at the world and making sense out of the out of them and and putting them together. Uh, and I think I've I've achieved that. Um, the the key insight occurred on one of my trips to Ohio State to to meet with Dave Woods, we had quite a few long days together discussing all sorts of things. And it occurred to me that Herbert Simon's um dictum of uh cognitive limitations was and I always felt it was misguided. I wasn't particularly thrilled with Herbert Simon. Um, but it dawned on me that that what he was getting at was just one piece of the puzzle. And the other pieces of the puzzle were sort of hidden, uh or at least not made clear in what Dave Woods called his families of laws, five families of laws. Fundamental bounds on cognitive work systems. And it hit me like a lightning bolt. And right away it started to, it started to all come together and it all started to make sense. And so it's got uh a subject matter, all the characteristics of a well-formed scientific theory. It's got a subject matter, it's got uh meta or uh metaprinciples about falsification, that sort of thing. It's got a set of laws, uh, and and all of that. It's just a matter of sitting down and writing it all out. The the only thing that I've published that comes close to laying it out is uh a thing I did with Dave Woods, an essay called Simon's Slice making the point that he he had just identified one piece of it, one piece of the pie. Um, the rest of it I've presented in various posters, mostly in posters at at meetings. And then pulling in Gary Klein's data frame model, the Flexecution model and uh realized that there were uh other models that were missing that had the same general morphology. Uh one is a model of teaming, another is a model of uh uh of um developing expertise and then the fifth is uh a model of mental projection to the future. That one that was hard. I'm still not entirely satisfied with it, but um all those models are there, they all look pretty much the same as the data frame model, that is they're uh two loop models, one of the loop is an one of the loops is an embedded loop and it all makes sense. It's um, it's a way of taking lots of complexity and making it elegant. And that to me is a really important criterion for this kind of scientific theory that's dealing essentially with complexity, uh, a very complex problem. Uh and that that has always been exciting to me. Um, I feel in my heart and in my mind that that the theory is is essentially done. Uh, it'd be nice to be able to get it out there and hopefully before too long I'll be doing that. Good question. Thank you.

**Speaker 5**
And and so, um, is your vision that this will be a book or where where should we look for this?

**Speaker 3**
I I'm not sure. I've got a whole filing cabinet of of one, two, three, four drawers of stuff that I think is most directly pertinent that could be potentially cited. But I'm also thinking it might be a really short, slim book with just the really key stuff without a lot of references. I at this point I'm just not sure.

**Speaker 5**
Yeah. Yeah. It does sound like this um, this idea of of big unifying theories has been a theme for you, even in earlier in your uh career, you were interested in these kind of big um theories of how people think and interact with the world.

**Speaker 4**
So, given that, uh and you sort of mentioned falsifiability in there somewhere, what what ideas, past or current, um, do you think sort of present the strongest challenge to NDM or um, you know, sort of the the the macro cognitive approach. What what do you see as sort of the strongest challenges?

**Speaker 3**
Graduate education.

**Speaker 4**
Right, that was not the kind of challenge I was looking for, but I completely appreciate why you said that. I mean, if if if you're if you're putting together sort of a a an overarching theory then, um, presumably as you said, that theory's got to predict things, it's got to, uh, you know, follow certain approaches. But but I'm sort of wondering, um, are there findings that people could come up with, say in the lab or elsewhere, uh, that might make the NDM community, um, uh, think again about the way that it looks at the world or the way that we think about the way that people make decisions or experts behave? Are there are there sort of uh what are the falsifiable pieces of of the NDM perspective?

**Speaker 3**
That's a good question. Um, and it it's actually a whole bunch of questions, of course, very much. Um, in in in the theory is as it exists right now, um, the primary, um, uh metatheoretical postulate about falsifiability is a sort of a twist on uh girdle's theorem. Uh and what I assert is that the uh postulates in the theory are consistent, but that the theory is necessarily incomplete. So, the path to falsification is to show some sort of inconsistency. So, you've got each of the each of the families of laws involves one, in some cases two or three basic tradeoffs. Uh and we're witnessing one right now, dare I say it, I don't want to be an ambulance chaser, but we're witnessing one right now with the coronavirus where the fundamental bound is on resource limitations. And people are dealing with uh what is uh what might be called an acute problem, that is this immediate urgency. And yet we see everybody asking questions about, well, why didn't you prepare for this years ago and and how could you have, you know, done a better job of of positioning uh society to to cope with all of this and why didn't we have more respirators stock piled and all of that? And that would have been treating it as a a chronic problem, a long-term chronic problem. And it's since your resources are limited, you've got to you've got to balance that trade-off at any one point in time with all the factors that enter into it. So if if if a politician had said 20 years ago, well, we need to build a stock pile of of 500,000 respirators, uh, people would have said, are you kidding? You don't have the money to do that. We've got all these other important things to do. So there there are these there are these tradeoffs. So that's just one family of laws. There are other families of laws that involve other tradeoffs. So an inconsistency would be if I've figured out a sweet spot for this particular tradeoff, it shouldn't necessarily uh negate or mitigate uh any effort to balance one of the other tradeoffs. So that's a path to falsification. Uh and as I say, the the the premise is that the theory is necessarily incomplete. I think that comes as part of what it means to be a theory of complex systems. I think that's kind of an answer to your question.

**Speaker 4**
It is a answer that we will be thinking about for quite some time until your book comes out, but um

**Speaker 3**
I want to get back I want to get back I want to get back to my first answer to your question, which is about graduate school. Uh, time and time again, I see young people coming out with degrees in psychology and degrees in computer science who are willfully under educated. Just mindbogglingly under educated. Computer scientists who don't know much about the history of the field of AI and work that was done in the 70s and 80s and so they end up reinventing wheels, uh coming up with their own new ideas which are bright and brilliant and insightful, but they've been around for a long time. They give it a new name because they have to seem special uh and all of that and they just they're just not adequately trained in history uh of of their own field. and I think the same for uh for a lot of people that I see, at least the ones I see, there's a bias there because there are lots I don't see uh of people in in psychology who are who are under trained and and they're taught there's rampant voodoo thinking. there's rampant voodoo thinking about statistics. especially with regard to null hypothesis significance testing. Uh people don't understand statistics as an exploratory tool suite. They take it as a way of abrogating the responsibility to make sound scientific judgments. Oh, I got an effect size of 1.5 and that's the holy Grail and and lots of lots of voodoo thinking. So I advise people to read papers like Gigerenzer's paper on mindless statistics. I invite people to take courses in the history of psychology, the history of science and God, it's amazing how many programs in undergraduate and graduate psychology don't require students to take good courses in the history of the field or courses in philosophy of science. It's just, I think that's a major obstacle to the progress of the field of psychology and the field of computer science and not just the particular paradigm of naturalistic decision making.

**Speaker 4**
You you didn't mention, you didn't mention methodology in terms of how to do this kind of research and that seems to me to be another area that's missing. Do you do you find that, um, how how do you help people who express an interest in this field?

**Speaker 3**
NDM NDM research of course involves going out into the world uh and maybe you can bring some of the world back into the laboratory. Good research does a little bit of both. You take aspects of the laboratory out into the world and bring the world back into the laboratory. and I've been saying for years that of course in field research is possible to control and manipulate variables and do all those other grand things. I've done it myself many times. So seeing a sharp bifurcation between those is not the right way to go. But it's the legacy of academic psychology. You have to run experiments that can be conducted with college freshman and then end up end up making conclusions about people. Uh and the experiments have to last about the duration of a college class, uh and they have to have toy problem that has to be a toy problem because it's a reductive research context. And so when you say to people, well, hey, you know, why don't you you go look out there in the real world? They say, oh well, it's difficult. Oh, grumble, grumble, grumble. Uh, we see a similar version of that in computer science where they say, well research is hard and we're trained in computer science, we don't get brownie points for doing experiments, we're not empericist. So we'll just throw a bunch of stuff at a web page and collect a ton of data on mechanical Turk and get P less than 0.01. Um, so I think I think it's a a paradigm limitation uh a a traditional paradigm that that has a serious limitation and people have been calling in into question in recent years. I'm not the only one. Paul Meal uh called the whole paradigm into question uh many decades ago and others Gigerenzer uh have been belly aching about it. Um, so I guess I guess I guess that's what I have to say about that. Did I answer your question?

**Speaker 4**
You did.

**Speaker 3**
Um,

**Speaker 4**
Yeah, so so one more uh from me, you you mentioned sort of getting out in the real world and I know you've had the opportunity to get out to lots of interesting real world places. I wonder if um, if over the years any particular stories or insights that you've learned from uh the experts that you've interviewed uh or watched, um kind of stick out to you as particularly insightful or uh they they think are illustrative of of what this whole field's about.

**Speaker 3**
Uh, well, yeah, uh two things come to mind, one very simple, although very powerful. Um, one of the experiments, um, I have done, which I'm still working on writing up right now in fact, involved, um, getting um expert weather forecasters to interpret some satellite images for me. And I wanted to have a control group, but this was a non-trivial task. And so I decided to run uh a group of people who were experts on expertise. Uh and run them through the same experiment, knowing that they would probably be able to generate um hypothesis about what I was researching and why I was researching it and what my hypothesis might be and that's okay. And so one of the people I ran in this test was Paul Feltovich. And we got into a discussion about, um, I I don't know back then if we called it cognitive task analysis or not. Um, and he said something to me that that ended up I think being very, very profound, which is in this in this kind of context, the cognitive field research or cognitive task analysis context. Never ask questions that can be answered yes or no. Because you won't find out anything. Always ask questions of the form, what are some ways in which blah blah blah blah. Uh, and that that's a very important, um, weapon to keep in one's hip pocket when when when interviewing experts. The other, um, the other experience that comes to mind is I spent a couple of summers down at the Core of Engineers, a place that back then was called the engineering topographic laboratory and I was learning about aerial photo interpretation from uh a couple of the the best aerial photo interpreters on the planet. Uh and one of them uh became a dear friend and mentor, a gentleman named Olan Mincer. Um, helped me considerably and and I learned a lot from him. And so I set about and one of the one of the projects I did, I set about trying to build what computer science would come to call an ontology. This was an ontology of land forms. Of course, there were lots of lots of dictionaries about geo morphology and and landform analysis, but nobody had created something like uh a semi-formal uh ontology that's based on uh propositional representation. And so I was interviewing him and running through various experiments, trying to get at the question of how to most effectively elicit the knowledge of of experts. Uh, this eventually became a publication in AI Magazine which had a big impact and pleased me very much. It was one of my best pieces of work. And, um, along the way, I was asking him various questions about different, uh, rock types and land form types and and how one could analyze them and interpret them from aerial photographs. Uh, now the the backstory on this is I had spent quite a few summers when I was a kid studying geology and uh, minerals and fossils and so on at the Cincinnati Museum of Natural History. Cincinnati, um, and the surrounding region, uh, sits on a an ancient formation that's called the Cincinnati formation. Where you dig down beneath the top soil and you're just going to come up with handfuls of fossils. I mean, fossils everywhere. So, summer after summer after summer I would be down at the at the park and the creek digging through the clay and the mud, pulling up all kinds of fossils, brachiopods and cryid and trilobites and just all kinds of all kinds of stuff. And so I'd studied, um, mineralogy and fossils and I knew a little bit about that kind of stuff. So when I got to the Core of Engineers, you know, we're talking about, you know, sandstone and you know, other kinds of rock types and so on, I kind of had some idea of what what was going on. But then we were getting Olan and I were getting into some details about about uh particular land forms and the way that you if if you're driving along an expressway and you look off to the side and you see the hills, from the angle and the contour of the hills, you can make some inferences about the nature of the of the bedrock. Uh and I just happened to ask him, you know, what what is limestone? And and at the time I thought, what a stupid damn question. to ask, you know, this world class civil engineer, what is limestone? And I but I just asked him. And he paused and he and he scratched his head and and he said to me, you know, that's a really interesting question. Uh, this other fellow over there, I won't mention his name, other other civil engineer. He he and I've been having a long debate about what we mean by limestone. Well, it turns out limestone is a conceptual category and there are lots of variations on it and its composition and its uh metamology and and all of that sort of stuff. And so we got into a long discussion about that and that was very, very illuminating. So what I took away from that is and and it's the old adage but when you when you actually experience it when you're doing cognitive task analysis with an expert it really gets driven home and that is never ever be afraid to ask what you think might be a stupid question. Never. And it's not just that you'll get an interesting answer, which I did in the case of limestone, but it also helps establish rapport with the expert. It shows them that you're not afraid to ask stupid questions, which is a good thing. Uh and maybe you'll get a chuckle out of it and that'll help establish rapport. So it serves it it serves a number of purposes. So those two things, never answer, never ask questions that can be answered yes or no, and never be afraid to ask stupid questions.

**Speaker 5**
That is great advice. Um, so, so Robert, um, I know lots of people know you as a a scientist, but as we're talking, you're giving us these little insights into your life, your hippie days and your interest in music and and I'm wondering if there's something about you that our audience probably doesn't know that you you'd like you could share with us.

**Speaker 3**
Oh boy, how personal do you want to get? Uh, there are lots of things about me that lots of people don't know. Uh, I'd like to think that most people know that I have an unbridled sense of humor. Uh, I like to think that people understand that I am at least sometimes capable of pulling my punches even though I'm told I can be intimidating. that is that is never my intent. unless somebody said something that's incredibly stupid, in which case my hair catches on fire or I'll leave the room. Um, what do they not know? Oh, I don't know. I like to I like to refinish and restore damaged Art Deco furniture. Um, I like to read comic books or my extensive comic book collection. I like to read mystery novels. I binge watch Perry Mason and Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes and David Suche's Hercule Poirot. Um, I still play the drums. Just got a beautiful new drum set a couple of years ago, uh, which I've wanted for a long, long time.

**Speaker 5**
What kind of music?

**Speaker 3**
Uh, what kind of music do I play or do I like? I like I like I like many kinds of music. I don't care that much for Opera. It's usually Opera is usually in a language I don't understand and it usually ends up with somebody killing somebody else and I can only take so much of that. Uh but other than that, I like all kinds of music. Uh there's some great world music going on like um the after Sound system, uh King Sunny day. Um, I love, well, my my professional inclination was blues, uh blues music, uh rock and roll, played a lot of rock and roll, work my way through college playing rock and roll and blues. Um, I like to listen to uh some newer stuff. I'm a prime, a huge prime fan. Um, what else? Oh, I don't know. Jazz, of course, Weather Report. Um, I guess that covers a gamut.

**Speaker 5**
Yeah, thanks. Thank you for sharing that.

**Speaker 4**
Sure. I think people might be surprised to learn what a big football fan you are.

**Speaker 3**
I like professional football. Um, I I'm I'm a hypocrite about it. But I like it. Um, it's an interesting combination of of like chess and nuclear war. And um, I I respect the people who are basically willing to sacrifice their lives and their health in order to entertain us. But when when when football and not just professional, also college level, although I I I I'm less inclined to like college football. I appreciate the fact that it feeds professional football, but I think it could be a little bit distracting from from academics. Uh but when a when a professional football game is well played, by that I mean it's the players show consummate skill, nobody gets hurt. Um, it's really quite beautiful. And the best way to to appreciate that that that I recommend to people is try and go to a professional football game where you can get a seat as close to the playing field as possible. Down at the level of the players. And you realize how what they do is so incredibly difficult, the patterns they can perceive and an instant, uh perceiving dynamic patterns, very complex dynamic patterns in an instant and act with incredible physical endurance and skill is uh it's it's a lot of fun. And I've I've become especially, um, what? Uh, endeared of the sport uh as a result of the devastation of the hurricanes in in New Orleans and, um, both my wife and I will always be lifelong fans of of the Saints and will always uh root for them, especially in the last two seasons where they got screwed out of a Super Bowl game by bad refereeing in the last play of the game. Absolutely incredible. Um, but yeah, I like professional football. It's it's it's fun to watch. We also go to University of West Florida games, last year University of West Florida won the National Championship. Uh, this year unfortunately they're probably not even going to have a season. There's not going to be anything for a year, uh, if people are smart, which is a big assumption. Um, but uh, we root for the local teams.

**Speaker 4**
a follow up on the dynamic patterns idea, do you think methods of cognitive task analysis can be fruitfully applied to athletes in those kinds of situations?

**Speaker 3**
Oh, sure. People like Paul Ward has done that. Paul Ward has done that in soccer, David Eckless did that for uh orienteering. Um, who else? Um, uh, the the work that's been done by uh uh some some of our UK friends and um, and others in policing, um, active shooter kinds of incidents. Yeah, sure, sure. And they've, excuse me, to some extent had success in bringing the world into the lab with their using their uh high fidelity simulations. So that's a good good example of of applied NDM or, well, I think all NDM is applied but uh uh but a good example of NDM research in in that general arena.

**Speaker 4**
So athletes you believe have have the kind of recall necessary to discuss at the level of detail those kinds of patterns that they see and Oh

**Speaker 3**
yeah, that's part of their job part of their job. You can see him in the sidelines looking at looking at snapshots and they they analyze it in group discussions in great, great, great detail. I mean, very fun grain of detail. Sure, they can talk about what they perceive and and and and and how they respond to it. Yeah, sure.

**Speaker 4**
Excellent. So I'd like to switch gears a bit uh and ask you a few terms and do a bit of an associative thinking exercise, which I'm sure you'll be thrilled about.

Um, I've got fluorescent minerals from all over the world, very large collection and they are all very heavy and absolutely drop dead gorgeous.
