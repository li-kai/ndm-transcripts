**Laura:** The Naturalistic Decision Making podcast with Brian Moon and Laura Millatella. This podcast series brings you interviews with leading NDM researchers who study and support people who make decisions under stress. Welcome to the Naturalistic Decision Making podcast. This is Laura Millatella from Applied Decision Science.

**Brian:** And I'm Brian Moon from Paradigion Technologies.

**Laura:** Today we welcome our friend Mike McClosky. Mike is the founder of 361 Interactive. He is grateful for the privilege of studying and supporting decision makers in over 100 military and commercial domains over the past 25 years. These domains include intelligence analysts, special operations forces, computer hackers, cyber security personnel, intelligence analysts and firefighters. He speaks both psychology and engineering and enjoys helping to bridge the gap between these often disconnected worlds. In his free time, Mike spend enjoys spending time with his family, backpacking, playing several sports poorly, and eating the hottest foods on the planet. He has a master's degree in psychology and a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Dayton. Welcome, Mike. Thanks for joining us today.

**Mike:** Hey, thanks a lot for having me. I appreciate it.

**Laura:** Yeah. So you founded 361 interactive nearly 20 years ago. I wanted if you could just tell us a little bit about what it was like to establish a small business and kind of how that's evolved over the years.

**Mike:** Yeah, it's it's been interesting. I kind of I won't say I stumbled into it, but um, as as I think you both know, I started off um at Klein associates for several years and, you know, had uh a great time, learned a lot and did a lot of really interesting projects. Um, one of these projects we actually had a a new, um, I guess subcontractor developing some interactive tools for us. And I was caught studio 361, and they were also sort of a a corporate branding firm as well, very another very small company. Uh, but it was really kind of cool the things they did in in applying a lot of our really interesting findings to develop some really um really not not necessarily just flashy, but really neat innovative interactive products. And so that was a really kind of neat mix for me. And so I developed a relationship with those folks and eventually, um sort of transitioned out of Klein Associates into Studio 361 as their director of interactive learning, um, but continuing to work with Klein, um, quite a bit. And so I worked with those folks for a while and we had some success where, um with some, um SBIR efforts, uh, some work for the centers for disease control developing some interactive games for uh teaching kids healthy behaviors through um through games and educational uh resources for teachers and health educators. And so eventually I sort of branched off from those folks and started 361 interactive here locally where it's just myself. Um, and really, um, I'm not the best uh fundamental researcher, but I really enjoy applying things that smart people do. So taking uh findings and then applying them to whether it's uh training uh interfaces, organizational redesigns, that kind of stuff. I just really like the application. So I'm I'm uh 361 interactive is probably uh heavy into the applied area. And so that's what we've been doing a lot. Uh, recently done a ton of stuff in uh cross cultural competence been very fortunate to work in that. And uh lately we've been doing a lot in the Intel community, but dabbling more in things like crowdsourcing now, things like that and um you know have um continuously new folks joining us, but uh a lot of a lot of good friends have been with me for from almost from the start, like, you know, Dave Cancela, Julio Mateo, folks like that. Um But yeah, so it's it's we've evolved but um uh kind of um evolved but stayed the same, I guess, just doing different interesting very applied research, applying um, you know, naturalistic decision-making research into, I guess new and different areas.

**Laura:** So what is what is one of the most exciting things you're working on right now?

**Mike:** Uh, well, right now we're doing a project for the Navy. We're developing a uh a crowdsourcing tool. So, um the sponsor was very interested in uh, I think he'd had a lot of experiences with large hierarchical organizations and was very frustrated with the inefficiencies that arise in these organizations and how poorly they are identified, prioritized and solved. And so he ha he had us come in to develop a crowdsourcing tool, which we're in the midst of right now, that can help these large organizations both identify and resolve their problems and their inefficiencies organically. So leveraging their own, um workforces versus hiring high priced consultants to come in uh and solve the problems for them and giving them just a snapshot in time. So we're trying to create a dynamic system that, um is always evolving, always kind of giving the latest here here's kind of like the the health of our organization, here are the issues that our people have identified, here's how they prioritized them. And then once you kind of identify which ones are the the the most pressing ones, leveraging that workforce uh through some innovative crowdsourcing algorithm techniques to collectively solve those problems and those inefficiencies. So we're working a lot with um and again, this is where we're taking research that other folks have done and but trying to put it all together, um, we know taking taking some, um work that's been done by folks at, um, you know, Stanford, Yale, MIT who developing some very specific algorithms to, um, basically apply crowdsourcing techniques to get the most out of your uh out of large numbers of people. But so we try to pick and choose from those but try to integrate that into a very, um, you know, decision centered solution, um, based on the types of problems that large organizations have. So again, they're doing some fundamental research and we're trying to take that really good stuff and apply it, uh, to large organizations. So we've been learned a lot and we're continuing to learn a lot from our, uh, large organization partners ranging from, you know, a Fortune 500 company to a large healthcare organization, um, you know, folks, you know, ranging in size from maybe a thousand people to tens and tens of thousands of folks and trying to figure out what how do we design something that'll be both useful and used by by them, cuz that's been kind of a neat one.

**Laura:** So I was I was going to follow up um Mike, so when you say crowd sourcing, I think about things like Reddit. What does crowd sourcing look like in the context of a business or or a large institution?

**Mike:** Well, uh a big thing with with uh working with these large institutions is, you know, obviously they have thousands of employees at a lot of different levels. Each employee has sort of like their own unique perspective on, um, what they feel the issues they're facing are. A lot of times, uh these organizations are stoke piped as well. So, um, you know, lessons aren't getting learned, issues aren't getting shared across the organization. And so when we say crowdsourcing with these large groups, it's basically trying to get collective input from volunteers anonymously so that they'll feel like their input is safely obtained and then sort of how do we what kind of things do we try to draw out from them and then how do we collectively organize that and determine, okay, from these little bits and pieces, these little snapshots of the organization looking from all these different perspectives, all these different levels, how do we identify how do those key issues rise to the top? And then how do those get so so how do we prioritize those? How do we determine, okay, what are the ones that are the really the most most critical and the most wide-reaching? And then when we do that, then how do we open that up for again, the crowd so that any employee who's interested in helping can contribute to solving that problem. So there's an ideation stage where, you know, it could be somebody it could be a, um, you know, a very junior level employee to a senior level employee could could be contributing to to solve this problem. They might have a they might have a piece of the answer, but how do we create a system that'll allow them to contribute based on their, I guess their awareness, contribute to that solution, but then how do you pull all that together to something integrated integrated and cohesive? You know, there there are algorithms, um, one called mechanical novel, for example, we didn't write but we're we're leveraging elements of it. It's like how do you, um, take a a input from a lot of folks to somehow create uh a novel? You know, different people'd be writing different different pieces of it, different people'd be editing these different pieces, but somehow through the magic of crowdsourcing, uh a novel will result. So you'll get some integrated product that is better than the, you know, better than some of its parts. And so again, we're trying to take, uh, take things we've learned from what other people are doing and then try to pull those together and say, okay, but what'll really work then in these constraints of an organization? So you have anonymity and you have, you know, different folks at different levels contributing. So it's a combination of, um, you know, taking some of that research but also then doing our own experimentation on on how to reconfigure a system to, um, you know, to weigh and scale things. You know, little things like there's a something called a bag of lemons approach, which I hadn't heard of and it's basically, um, research that has shown it's a lot easier for people in general to say what they don't like about ideas, if you give them a if you give them a bunch of ideas, um, it's apparently harder for us as humans to say what are the ones we think are the best, but it's easier for us to say, hey, these are the garbage ideas, these are the ones we don't like. And so we try to integrate that into our testing and see if we get better resultant products by using approach kind of like that. And then how do people identify if you have a whole bunch of ideas that are being contributed, how do you let people together try to figure out how ideas interrelate, which ones are redundant, and again, which ones are sort of like optimal, and which ones work better together. So we're trying to do experimentation around that as we develop our tool.

**Laura:** This is fascinating. Initially, you're trying to find a way that people can kind of safely and anonymously submit ideas. But then as you're really moving into the solution phase, at that point do people, uh know who each other is so that they can begin to really collaborate and push back and forth?

**Mike:** No, and that's really one of the trade-offs cuz what we what we found in working with the large organizations is there's there there is an, uh, inhibition to really contribute. It it's a balance and it's something that the the crowdsourcing community is is really, you know, it's one of the big research areas is how do you protect anonymity while still holding people accountable or still enabling recognition when recognition is wanted? So it's a real balancing act. And so, you know, there there are different kind of kind of technical ways to address that, but um, but it is something that that we've struggled with as well. We as we've done our research. But yeah, but throughout the whole thing, people are, uh, in our current uh version of the system, people are still anonymous.

**Laura:** Fascinating.

**Mike:** Yeah, it's been a neat project for us.

**Brian:** So Mike, that that feels uh a fair distance away from the sort of individual expert stuff that we're working on together at Klein. Do you, um, are what are the parallels or or maybe, you know, what's it like sort of working in this, uh, domain where you're worried more about sort of the the metadata than the individual perspective?

**Mike:** Yeah, it's definitely different. I mean, I I think what what pulls it together, maybe a common thing is, um, decision-making, right? Cuz but we're we're looking at a very high level at how do large organizations make decisions. So one of the first things we did is work with these folks and say, how are you currently doing it? How are you figuring out what your problems and your issues are and then, um how are you or aren't you, um, leveraging or uh soliciting inputs from your across the workforce. How do you know you're getting a representative sample, are you? And then once you identify what you think these issues are, how do you go about solving and resolving them? So we and and and where is it broken? And so, you know, we did some CDMs there, we tried to say, you know, what are some representative cases where this has worked or hasn't worked. And so we try to before we even you know our our line, you know, that I think is a fairly common before you write a line of code that's really understand the environment. And our sponsor didn't care about that as much because he wanted a tool and he wanted uh us to apply all these different algorithms, but I think maybe what was unique in our approach and why we got the work is because well, you know, let's really again, let's understand the environment we're operating in. You know, we can make the best tool in the world, but if we don't understand what it's like to put it in, um, you know, embed it within a large organization and their differences across these organizations too, which we had to account for. And so, um, I think our argument is saying, hey, you know, before we make this tool, let's really understand the folks that we're trying to support. How do they currently do it? What are the barriers to effective, um, issue identification and, um, you know, and what would fly in an organization too, across levels. What are the inhibitors of participating in something like this as a junior person, as a mid-level, you know, as an executive? What does leadership need to know? How does it need to be designed so that they can actually take these findings and then implement them. But again, how do you engage people to participate in it while ensuring that they're anonymous? But if they're anonymous, they can't be rewarded. And so it's you really want to try to get it, you know, what are some of the more intrinsic uh motivations for engaging? So we're looking at motivation, we're looking at individual decision-making, you know, willingness to engage and participate, uh large corporate decision-making. So I I think it still had all those elements and we did do, um, you know, some of that, you know, CTA, CDM stuff that that is kind of foundational and the bottom line is is we're trying to help decision-making.

**Brian:** Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense. Are you finding that that sort of pitch of, uh, let's understand the decision-making up front is what helps attract customers to your work?

**Mike:** Yeah, honestly, I really do. You know, Brian, if if, you know, I whenever we're proposing for, you know, for things, I always try to think about what are most of the people going to be proposing? And I think a lot of folks, if you look at, you know, for example when solicitations come out, uh, you know, I'm preaching to the choir here, but you know that folks often have a solution in mind when what is really needed is to better to first understand the problem and those users and be advocates for their decision-making. Um, because people are going to say, hey, I got this greatest idea, here's how I'm going to solve your problem. And so what we try to tend to do is, hey, we're going to, you know, I can say up front sometimes the kind of they throw people office, I don't know how to solve your problem, but I know how to figure out how to solve your problem and that's based on understanding, you know, the the people that you're trying to support first. And so that's I think a common theme of of um, a lot of what we do and propose.

**Brian:** Right. And hopefully those reviewers get past that first line, right?

**Mike:** hopefully. Yeah, and might might explain why sometimes uh never hear from them again.

**Brian:** Right.

**Laura:** Right. So Mike, if you think back over your career, what project has been the most rewarding for you?

**Mike:** Oh, wow. There's been a lot, but I'd say I think by far, um, it's not a single project, but it's the series of projects where we work with the Navy SEALS in developing training for them. Um, and so so new uh Navy SEALS when um, you know, when they're brand new, when they're called pups, seal pups, they have to go through a uh uh something called a pipeline. So they have to go through 18 months of uh training. And it's pretty intensive stuff and they get really essential critical skills here. They get, you know, all the the uh survival and escape and combat and weapons handling, all those, you know, really, really critical skills that uh the technical skills. But they were really lacking in um cultural skills training. And a lot of people would say, well, so what, right? You know, they're maybe SEALs, they have to go out and take out Ben Lad. Um, but it turns out that a a large majority of a large portion of their missions is, um has nothing to do with combat. Um, they often have to train foreign forces, that's a big part of their, um, big part of their mission. And they often have to gather atmospherics and go to, um, you know, distant, uh, distant locations where they're not familiar with their culture and they have to build rapport, they have to build relationships in order to achieve their missions. And so, uh, there was some leadership out at uh on the West Coast who, um, recognized this. And so they they they knew about our cultural we've been doing cultural cross cultural competence fundamental research and then some applied research since about 2007. Uh, very fortunate to have that work and work with a lot of really cool folks. But um, we developed, um, you know, kind of one of the first foundational models that's empirically based on what makes a war fighter cross culturally competent. So you can drop them in a new environment, unfamiliar cultural environment and they can immediately be, uh, mission effective and adaptable and adjustable, being able to observe and interpret individual and group dynamics, you know, what is it about those folks who can be immediately effective? And so we studied that, we developed uh some models of competence and how that evolves. And so this, um, these folks had heard about our work and so they asked us to come out and look at a a training course that they had a sort of an old salty person putting on for for supposedly cultural skills. And so we went out, um, that's actually Julio, Matteo and I, we went out to we're just supposed to be observing this this course. And um, it turned out, you know, the the the course was all about just telling stories and and and showing some uh interesting movie clips, things like that. And it was very entertaining, but it really wasn't getting at the skills and the aptitudes that are necessary. Um, and at the same location they have language instructors and these instructors were from um, you know, a bunch of different key areas or regions where Navy SEALs are often deployed to. And um, and, you know, and so we were just talking with some of they said, well, what a cool resource. Wouldn't it be neat to have a, um, sort of a, you know, a field exercise where you use some of these folks and give them actual practice in interacting with local cultures. And so, um, uh, one of the, uh, I guess one of the people were out there when we were just observing, one of the one of the uh, one of the folks out there said, hey, that sounds like a great idea. Once you guys uh do that on Friday. And this was Wednesday. And uh, it's a Julio and I were freaking out, right? And um, And it's like, uh, holy crap. They're like, yeah, that would be great. Just do it on Friday, do it on the last day. And so, I mean, I I'll never forget those next that next day and a half that we were, um, we basically, we had to train these uh foreign language instructors, an an awesome amazing group of folks, um, had to train them to, um, be specific role players in this cultural village. And so we created this little, um, you know, this this scenario, um, that involved going into this village to gather atmospherics, but each of these different sort of stations in this village represented a different culture. And so, and so some people are like, there's no way that's so that's so, um, unrealistic. Why would you even do that? That'll never work. And I'm like, well, you know, let's try. I think it's kind of a cool idea. So, um, we created the sort of six station village in their little, um, in a little place where they do their survival escape resistance training at the little village. Um, but but um, we had roles for them and we had sort of a story unfolding in this multi-cultural village. And the idea was not to make it super, um, super totally authentic, but to make it cognitively authentic. We wanted to put them into situations where they had opportunities to observe, to interact and to make mistakes and hopefully learn from them. Um, so we were creating this this um, situation. And in my past work interacting with some folks who had had amazing, um, you know, over 20 years of experience in just interacting with diverse cultures and the performance of their missions, civil affairs folks, special forces, military transition teams, these folks were really immersed in the cultures when they deployed. There's this one Colonel who was talking to me in one one evening and he's like, uh this is when I was trying to figure out what cross cultural competence was all about. He's like, he's like, Mike, I I'll tell you what, I can you show me, um, you show me any soldier and I can tell you under certain circumstances, I can tell you within five minutes whether or not they're going to be good out on a cultural deployment or whether they're going to be bad. I'm like, it's amazing. What what do you need to see? He's like, show me what they're like when they first meet their interpreter. And I was like, ah, that's interesting and he started talking about that. He said, I can tell when somebody meets the interpreter for the first time, how they're going to be in an immersive environment. And it's like those people who are, um, you know, basically treat them, you know, just like they're just like a a resource and nothing more, they don't introduce themselves, they don't find out, you know, that um that those people are going to be unsuccessful. Now look at those people who take the time to introduce themselves, to ask them some questions about them, how they became an interpreter, um, what their history is, do they have family, why, you know, why are they doing this job, what they hope to get from it, um, you know, they're and then they start then they start asking them about, okay, we're going to go into this village here. Is there anything you can tell me about it? Okay, you know, give me, you know, the information there. So they use them as a resource, but they're also treating them as individuals, um, and they're also building rapport because a good interpreter can make or break, uh, an interaction and even parts of a deployment. And so I'd learn more and more about this and study more about it. And so we identified, um, you know, a lot of characteristics, things people do with their interpreters, um, right when they first meet them. And so we incorporated that into this immersive village. So they're going to six different stations like uh Yemen, Iran, the Philippines. Uh I'm just I'm throwing out hypothetical countries here. But what we do in this Friday, this last day of the uh uh of the of the SEAL training, uh so we created this environment where they go and interact, but each time they go to a new station, they eat an interpreter for the first time. And so we would watch them interact and uh each time, we and the interpreter would give them just a little bit of feedback. We'd have them reflect a little bit, how thing how might things have gone, you know, differently, you know, what'd you do, well, you know, I didn't I didn't know how to use my interpreter, I didn't know where to put him. I didn't even know their name. And so each time they do it, they'd get a little bit incrementally better, but they'd get better by making mistakes and learning from them and kind of reflecting upon them. And that was part of this rotation amongst this multicultural village. And in in the end, um, you know, Julio and I were just, we're beyond shocked to see how well this worked with these with these uh young folks that they actually got some hands-on experience in a safe environment practicing and making some mistakes. And when they made mistakes, the the role players who were amazing, um, really, um, put him on the spot, you know, if they didn't greet, if they didn't greet an elder with respect, that elder would get really angry with them and they'd like, and so we'd give them these sort of aha moments, um, that they said, wow, I'm never going to forget these, you know, and it was, you know, I totally see how I screwed up. And then they do a little better next time and then the next time. Um, so after we finished with that day, um, the sponsor, you know, the the the sponsor was totally convinced and they're like, okay, this is the kind of decision-making training we need. Um, and so we were brought on then right after that on the spot to do it ended up being, um, basically three years worth of efforts to develop a week-long curriculum that had this immersive training throughout and we had some classroom ex classroom exercises, we had some sort of multimedia tools that we developed to help people observe and interpret and sense making. And we put it all in the uh form of a week-long course that, um, all the SEALS that went through there then would go through, um, participate and then we started after we did that, we then trained former Navy SEALs to be the to be the uh teachers and also the evaluators, uh, of the course. And then we did some region specific training after that. But, um, all in all, it was I think by far one of the most rewarding projects we had. And, you know, it was just we were we were thrown in the fire, you know, we could have been given, uh, a few months to make that, you know, that one day of immersive cultural training, but the fact that we were given a day and a half and, uh, you know, somehow pulled it out was just really rewarding for us and just led to a lot of really good work. And, um, and it really I think working uh, a lot of lot of you probably, you know, you know Julio pretty well, is that we work really well together because I'm the kind of guy who just throws something against the wall and kind of see what sticks. And uh, I'll say, oh yeah, Julio, you know, research tells us, you know, that that this this will work. And he's like, uh, no, research doesn't say that at all. And I'm like, well, then it kind of says this, right? He said, no, no, no, it doesn't say that anywhere. So he's he's always the one who tells me what reality is. Um, but I'm the one who's willing to kind of, you know, like kind of take take some chances and try things. And so it worked it just worked really well and then we would continue with um, other team members then to develop and put on that training over a period of, you know, a few years and then, you know, refine it, develop some assessments for it and then train the trainers. And we when we left, we felt like we had a really good product that is really making a difference and very well received by the uh by the folks who went through it. And I and I I would like to think that it's really helped them in their deployments. People would come back and talk about how, you know, hey, this exact same thing happened to me out in out in the field. And so it's really neat to go through that on my own, you know, in this in this village or in your class. And so I'd say, yeah, by far that was probably one of the most rewarding series of projects we did.

**Laura:** There are so many things I love about this story. So one of them is I've I've just recently been reading some of the training literature, and there's a kind of a strong tradition of what some people call error avoidance training. And so the idea is you teach people the right way to do things and then you tell them to practice doing it the right way. And so there's this more recent movement that is really um exploiting the value of a more exploratory approach and the power of having people make mistakes and how how that sticks with people. It's just stickier kind of training than a more error avoidance approach in many cases. Um, so this is such a great example of that.

**Mike:** Yeah, it's you know, you think about your own life experiences and what's the stuff you remember? Like a lot of times you remember when you really screwed something up, right? Because it really sinks in. And so we really try to try to put those uh try to give folks those experiences as much as possible. And sometimes when I'm doing training regardless of whether it's seal training or even just general classroom training, sometimes I feel like I'm cheating people because I have the I'm having them interact more. I was like, oh, I'm the I'm the teacher. I should be talking more, I should be doing more. But those are the things that people always, you know, always come back and say, hey, this was my favorite part. You know, going through that, throwing me on the hot seat and having me make these mistakes and then coming back and obviously doing a, you know, kind of, you know, uh sort of a guided reflection on it and in a group format. But, you know, those are the things that people remember and it's always hard to hard to think, okay, you're not screwing them over by having them do stuff, you know, whether it's a training workshop or whatever, you know, people learn by doing and I think that's kind of like a key tenant of of of what we all try to uh try to emphasize.

**Laura:** Yeah, very cool. The other thing I really um uh am interested in your story is I think a lot of of culture preparation training uh trains you, here's here's what you need to know about this culture you're going to. It focuses on this specific situation. Um, but your training is more about developing the skills to adapt regardless of what culture you wind up in. Um, and so that feels like a really important twist here as well.

**Mike:** Yeah, it's true because a lot of these folks, a lot of people don't know where they're going to be going and they might be going to three or four different places. So, you know, we do like to and and and before they get deployed, they do get, you know, the the the military I think does a good job on things like smart cards and guides for, you know, the customs and the, you know, unique attributes of certain cultures that you want to, you know, phrases, things like that that you want to know before you go to a specific region, but I think there are a lot of general skills and aptitudes, you know, um, the the first thing in in any of our training that we always try to to to promote the folks is that this stuff is important and it's real, you know, because you still have a lot of people with hang-ups because cultural training is not, um, you know, it's not, oh, you know, let's go out and, you know, be soft and, um, you know, um, you know, just make friends with everybody. And and I think a lot of people have a a hang-up and they have these kind of preconceived notions that, no, I'm not going to do that. I'm out there and I have a mission. And so the the first thing we need to do is hit that awareness and say, you know, here's what it really is and here's why it's important to mission success. You know, if you can build rapport and relationships with a village, I can't tell you how many through CDM and other, um, you know, other interviews with folks, how many stories I have of people who have saved and lives saves because they built this built these relationships with with folks and then when an insurgent comes into town, they'll get, you know, these these villagers will actually retain, uh, detain the insurgent and and call the call the US forces in to come and get them. You know, they'll they'll actually say, hey, don't go down this road tomorrow because I saw somebody planning an IED there. And then you got to think second and third order effects, you know, yeah, okay, maybe maybe maybe it won't help me with my particular mission because I'm not going to be here that long, but there's going to be people coming that they're going to replace you and you need to think about them. You know, you need to think about about, you know, the long-term kind of thing. And you got to think about things like avoiding a CNN incident too. Um, you know, what are the things that are going to have lasting impact, your actions. And so awareness is the absolute first thing we hit is to try to help people become aware that cross cultural competence is a real thing and that it has a direct impact on mission success. And once we get that, people are more willing to engage, um, and then we can start hitting some of those, um, observation, sense-making skills and, um, you know, uh rapport building, relationship building, things like that. But again, you know, it's like we and that's why we uh the the way we left our training is we throw them in the hot seat right away. We give them, we'd have them go to that village on day one, hour one, without any training, and have them go in, we give them an interpreter, and then we watch as things just go, go, go to heck, you know? And um, and then we debrief it and then the difference from day one to day five, um, it's it's always nice to hear him say, wow, you know, I I can't believe what I was doing on the first day of this versus what I'm doing now, interacting with my interpreter, you know, how I'm interacting with these different pop, you know, pop, these are the things I'm looking at when I'm when I'm interacting. Um, so but again, it all starts with awareness, I think.

**Laura:** Wow, that's fantastic. So I want I want to ask for a different kind of story now. Um, so I know you've done a lot of field research in your career, and we all know that field research is not for the faint of heart. So, what is one of the craziest situations you've found yourself in in the name of science?

**Mike:** Well, I I can guarantee you'll learn nothing from this story, but that's okay. So there are a couple we we did a lot of interesting research with hackers and the way we did some data collections there were pretty interesting, but I I I'd say the most unique situation I found myself in was, um, is probably about, two three, maybe four about four years into Client Associates, uh, we've been working a lot with the Marine Corps and Gary, um, had built up a lot of relationships with different colonels in the Marine Corps. Um, you know, pretty respected relationships and it meant a lot to us to have these sort of trust relationships with these folks. Um, but one of one time this colonel was giving Gary a hard time saying, oh, you know, you researchers you study your decision-making in these nice warm buildings. You like, you know, like you to see how it is out here and out in the field and see how your decision-making is. And then so, um, and so he invited, uh, us or one of us to go to their, um, winter survival training. And so I remember, so Gary came to me and he's like, Michael, he's like, I need you to do this. And so at the time I was I was in much better shape and so the only he's like only, I think only you and Rob, Rob Hutten could do it, but Rob didn't have the clearance. He's like, I need to save face here. We need to send somebody to this winter training, um, and then maybe you can do some decision-making games, so do these little little pencil and paper exercises with people out, you know, in the middle of the survival training and then compare it with when we, uh, with, you know, the same exercises with people back in a, you know, in a more warm, fuzzy setting, right? Just to see if we get any differences and and how people respond to these uh rapid uh, I guess rapid response tactical decision games, decision-making exercises where you throw somebody a situation, so you got two minutes, here's a tactical situation, what are you going to do? And see if there are any differences. He said, just want you to go out there and he says, he said, basically I just want you to survive, you know, he said, he said, let's, you know, save face for the company. And I'm like, you know, yeah, I'll, yeah, I'll try it. And um, I remember, you know, I was kind of nervous. I got off I was off excited, had all these, uh, you know, paper exercises all printed out. And so we went out to a place called Pickle Meadows, which was in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Um, and so immediately I did that I actually had, you know, they gave me a gear, a uniform and I just got thrown with a, uh, I guess a platoon. It was company level. So it was a bunch of captains and got thrown with a, um, actually they're broken down by squads, so groups of 12. So I just got thrown with a squad. Um, and we marched, uh, had backpacks, 60 pound packs, we'd march up the mountain. Um, and first thing we had to do once we got to the top is dig our own snow caves to sleep in. I'm like, okay. And so, you know, and so we started, you know, just started doing that and and honestly I I forgot all about doing anything in terms of running any exercises and I was just trying to, you know, you know, kind of survive and stay along and get along. And so I'm, you know, dig digging snow caves, um, you know, we're, you know, we have MREs, you know, fixing our MREs and just busy kind of moving around. Um, you know, kind of staying alive kind of thing. And um, and at some point I remembered I had to do these exercises and so I went back to my pack and um, and pulled these things out and they'd gotten completely, uh, soggy and so they completely fallen apart. And so I'm like, uh, ended up collecting no data whatsoever. Um, but I know that it was for Gary, it's just a matter, you know, of uh, you know, showing that these researchers could go out here. And so, um, yeah, about three days into it, I remember, uh, I hadn't seen this colonel at all, but I know I wanted to kind of show up and say, hey, you know, yeah, we're Klein Associates, we're here and we're still alive. And, um, we were on skis most of the time. And so, um, I was starting to get used to it, skiing around. And so they were, he was down the kind of like this bottom of this hill. I was like, I'm going to go see him, see how, you know, let him know we're here, doing fine. So I'm like, you know, swishing over back and forth and then I'm coming up to him and uh he's with these majors and they're going over obviously some plan, you know. So I'm like, oh, I'm just going to figure out what's going on with the plan, give him some decision-making perspective. And, uh, I I had had a like a small pack on, so my weight was a little off balance and, um, I'd gotten closer and closer and all of a sudden I realized I was out of control and before I could, uh, before I realized it, I plowed into him. I sent I I sent the guy flying. This was the Colonel, this was the head of the whole thing. And uh, and uh, and you know, I didn't land on top of him because that would infer that I was near him, I sent him flying. And so, I was like seven or eight feet away and we're both on the ground. I just remember he got up and I was like, I was like scared to death. And he's like, he's like gets up ourselves off and he says, oh, researchers here. So, so yeah, I apologized profusely and stuff and um, yeah, you know, so then you know, then we had a good discussion and, um, basically I collected zero data that entire that entire trip. But, um, you know, as far as as far as a weird circumstance to be in, you know, we got to do, um, night movement by snowshoes, we for kind of like a final exam, we got heli lifted up onto a remote mountain top, our little, uh, squads. They dropped 10 of us off and we'd have to navigate our way to a whole new location, you know, things like that. And it was just really, you know, living building our own snow caves that we lived in. It was just a really amazing experience. You know, as far as a life experience is an absolutely amazing thing and the weirdest, uh, I guess naturalistic decision-making environment I've ever been in. You know, end result, you know, I think we at least held our own, you know, kind of saved some face as researchers, so Gary was really happy even though I didn't come back with any data whatsoever. But, uh, you know, it's just one of those things you, you know, so many experiences you don't you don't appreciate them as life experiences as you're going through them, but afterwards you look back on them and say that was, you know, that was really cool. And again, um, you know, kind of thing that sticks with you.

**Laura:** So, I kind of remember this. I remember you coming back from this trip and having all these stories, we were all in the conference room and somehow that story about nearly running over the Colonel wasn't part of the uh.

**Mike:** This is the first time.

**Laura:** This is the first time I've heard this piece.

**Mike:** Yeah, I don't know how much I shared that one. He was good natured about it. But I mean, you know, I thought I was getting really good at skiing and um, you know, um, and they were cross country skis in my defense, so. But um, yeah, I I completely lost control.

**Laura:** Hilarious.

**Mike:** But, but there are some, you know, these are these are Marine Corps captains, um, and, you know, a couple of the guys were were somewhat tall and they they could not get the hang of the skiing. And so, um, they didn't put these things cut skins on the bottom of their skis because it would slow them down and it was like, you know, it was like so, you know, it's what you would think is the most horrible thing that ever could have happened to them because they're insisting they were fine, but they kept falling over and, yeah, it gets a big thing about saving face. But it it was just a great experience and just, you know, interacting with those folks. I gained so much over the years, so much respect for the military because I know, you know, people have preconceived notions about what folks are going to be like, but especially the Marine Corps is such a well-read and and thoughtful and insightful group and they really, you know, they really, uh, have their officers and their enlisted people read, um, you know, be very well read on, you know, not just strategy, but but things like what it takes to be a leader, you know, Sun Sue, you know, how how not to fight, things like that. So, yeah, again, just just great, great experiences.

**Brian:** All right. So, so these stories, uh, are you going more than the next or mile to get traction, uh, in terms of, you know, being able to get get the data in some cases, uh, or at least sort of earn the the respect if you will of your, uh, you know, the the targets of your study. I'm wondering though, uh, do you have stories about where you've you've really struggled to get traction with your work? Uh, you know, either customers you thought you might be more receptive to what you're doing or, um, you know, ideas you wanted to pursue that you just can't seem to to get traction with?

**Mike:** Yeah, you know, Brian, there there, uh, you know, a couple of there are always going to be folks who are resistant to the cultural stuff because they see it as weakness, and they see it, you know, I'm training fighters, I'm train, I'm not training one one, uh, one Colonel said, I'm training fighters, not poof balls, you know, and it's just, you know, sometimes it's that that that would be an uphill battle trying to convince folks that this stuff is important and that it's about mission success. Um, one of the areas that that Julio and I and both really think would have a lot of value that we've we've struggled getting inroads to is taking this cultural skills training and applying it to, uh, police communities, police forces. Because I mean, think of the idea and I I we don't we haven't heard of anybody doing this, but this could be so powerful is just like we, uh, leveraged the, uh, language instructors to be role players for the Navy SEALs, that was so much learning, amazing amount of learning. Imagine if you could do this with local communities where you engage the local community to be role players to help put the police in, uh, uh, police forces in situations where they have to, um, you know, go in and practice building rapport in a community. They have to practice, you know, um, you know, deescalation skills, but interact, but doing so in cooperation with, um, with local communities. You know, because I think that's a key moving forward, um, is to get our police to interact with, um, you know, have real true and genuine collaborative interactions with local communities. And so, um, you know, we're we're hoping, Julio and I are both hoping, uh, especially Julio, he's passionate about this stuff, that we can get some inroads there, um, with, you know, kind of new and innovative police training that, you know, has the has the concurrent, uh, effect of getting the local community involved. And, you know, so they would play they would play roles, they'd be trained to be role players. And then afterwards, they'd be involved in the debriefing, you know, hey, you know, how do you, you know, where where did this where did this person go right or go wrong in de-escalating situation? How did they make you feel as you're interacting with them in the situation? What could have made it a lot worse? Um, you know, what what feedback specifically do you have for them? That could be that could really be invaluable, I think. And so, it's a it's sort of a different funding venue, you know, we're more familiar with Department of Defense research, so it's it's finding all those new inroads and then figuring out, okay, who really and what level do you do this? You have local, you have local, um, uh, police forces, you have, you know, you have state and then you have federal, um, resources. So just figuring all that out, we've we haven't quite tackled that one yet, but it's something we're very interested in doing.

**Brian:** Yeah, makes a lot of sense.

**Laura:** Yeah. So Mike, if you kind of reflect on your career, who are three people who have really influenced your approach?

**Mike:** I guess the first one, um, you know, obviously it's Gary, Gary Klein. Gary is the he's he's an amazing listener and there's so much power in listening because so few people do it do it well. And one of the things I remember this was this was pretty early on at Klein Associates. There was a, uh, a new very junior researcher right out of college just started at Klein. And one of the things that really stuck with me is watching Gary interact with her. And so at first I just thought he was just, you know, doing the whole friendly welcoming thing, but he was actually almost like interviewing her, just picking her brain about her own personal experiences and really, really listening. And the thing about the thing about Gary was I learned most from him, I think most of all is that everybody has experiences that you don't have and you can learn from, you know, there's stuff you can learn from everybody. Everybody knows, everybody has at least one area where they know a lot more than you know. And so and Gary just had this natural curiosity and such an active listener, um, and I think that really influenced me in terms of, you know, going out and and and interviewing folks, um, and just, you know, trying to take that perspective. So he's one. Um, there's another, uh, guy I worked with when I was a client associates and even afterwards called Doug Harrington Senior. He was a, uh, he was a trainer, he's a formal former naval naval aviator, but he also did a lot of training in nuclear power plants. Um, and so I started working with him on doing decision skills training while at Klein Associates for, um, naval air crews and and actually a bunch of different audiences. And so he was just this most, um, natural trainer I I'd ever seen. And thing about him too is he was very, he was um, he was quiet, he didn't try to fire hose people, and he was very, he kind of taught me to be comfortable with silence when talking with folks. And he's one who really taught me is like it doesn't mean that they're, uh, analyzing you and putting you on a spot, it means they're thinking, right? When you ask a question and people are quiet. Um, and he really helped me perspective take, um, as well. you know, when when doing the training, really understand that, you know, a lot of these people who come in for for training or even for interviews are probably feeling, um, you know, put on the spot, they feel like they're being judged, they feel like they're not going to have anything important or interesting to say. And so just, uh, appreciating that and just understanding that when you're, when you're up there in front of folks, they're not evaluating you, they're trying to, you know, they're in their own kind of bubble, trying to think about what are they going to say the right thing. And he just had this natural kind of calmness about him, um, which I always found really impressive. Um, so, uh, I guess I guess a third person, um, in the field would probably be and I know you you guys know, uh, you remember Dave Klinger, who was, um, you know, Dave was about the friendliest person, uh, around. And um, you know, I knew him from Klein Associates and he, um, you know, interviewing with Dave, I it it just I I I think one of the things I learned from him is that, um, that that influenced me the most is that it's like you can't take, uh, life or even little failures too seriously when you're at work. You know, it's like you can laugh at yourself a little bit and you can laugh at the situation if things are going wrong, if you're in the middle of a, you know, we're out in the middle of the California High Desert for a, uh, for an exercise and, you know, we're sleeping trying to keep scorpions out of our bags, he could always kind of see the humor in situations and make us, you know, kind of make us uh, make us all laugh at it. Um, but also that really would put, uh, put interviewees at ease as well and really said, you know, hey, there's a real importance here when you're trying to collect this kind of naturalistic data to, um, put people at ease, you know, and if you can kind of, you know, be genuine about that and um, you know, use humor in that way, it can it can make a lot of difference in success or failure of of interviews and your interactions. And it also can then, you know, you can generate some, you know, kind of follow on relationships there as well. So I think those are those are three folks kind of thinking about it a minute who really impact how I try to do how I try to do stuff in this area.

**Laura:** Nice. Yeah, as you mentioned Dave Klinger, one of the things I really, um, remember about him and interviewing or really just interacting with other humans is just his ability to make you feel like he was so interested in whatever you were talking about.

**Mike:** Yeah, definitely.

**Laura:** Yeah. I mean, he was, not he made you believe that. You just, but you could really feel it. Yeah. That was cool.

**Mike:** Yeah, and you just you would see people's demeanor after one minute of coming in, they're all tense and stressed and just uh, you know, just putting people at ease.

**Laura:** Yeah, yeah.

**Mike:** And so it's not, you know, and it probably that probably, you know, it probably shows to my weakness that it's not necessarily the the research that these folks did, but it's more just how they how they interacted with people that I found so impressive and and useful.

**Laura:** Yeah. That's very cool.

**Brian:** So Mike, uh, quick test on your uh NDM perspective. So,

**Mike:** Oh, no, don't. This can't this better not be a quiz about anything uh research related literature.

**Brian:** You meet a complete stranger who claims to practice NDM and on the pain of death, you are given one question to determine if they do indeed practice NDM. What would you ask?

**Mike:** I'd say, tell me about the last thing you learned from talking to somebody. You know, just what's the last thing you learned? And if it's something it last maybe the last thing last meaningful thing you learned. And see if it's superficial or see if it's something like a little deeper, you know? And then, you know, my my my first my first reaction to this question was going to be to, you know, throw it back at them. It's like if you had to if you had to ask one question to better understand, um, what I do for a living, what would your question be? You know, and see if it's an open-ended kind of asking for a story. I think, and so maybe that's not quite an NDM type answer, but it's a question to see, I don't know, I like to see if people are really active listeners and if they're asking, uh, questions that, um, probe deeper thought. Like the one you asked me, I'd just ask them that question, Brian.

**Brian:** Fair enough. That's good.

**Mike:** That's that's three different bad answers to one question. That's pretty impressive.

**Brian:** Nah, that was good. Got to admit.

**Laura:** Well, now we have another question that requires three answers. So, Laura?

**Laura:** Okay, so Mike, we want you to tell us two truths about yourself and one lie, and we're both going to try to guess what the lie is.

**Mike:** Crick. Only one lie? Um,

**Laura:** Right, two truths, one lie.

**Mike:** Yeah, okay. So, okay, uh, George Bush W once asked me about my lunch. Um, keeping with the theme, I was almost eaten by an alligator. And, uh, I once won a pie eating contest as a child, and they cut me off after three pies.

**Mike:** Notice the food theme? I didn't realize. I had the issue, I have serious issues. I'm I'm actually a chubby kid still on the inside.

**Brian:** Well, you wore food in one of 'em.

**Mike:** Almost.

**Laura:** You going to go first, Brian?

**Brian:** Yes. And I am going to say uh, the Gator is the lie.

**Laura:** All right. I'm going to say that, oh, this is hard. I'm going to say the pie eating contest is the lie.

**Mike:** Well, one of you is correct. Uh, I never won a pie eating contest. I won I won a couple of food eating contests. But yeah, congratulations, Laura. I think you know me, Laura. Deep down. I was I was ashamed of my weight problems, so I wouldn't brag about eating a lot of pie. Yeah, although I probably did eat three pies at a time, I never did it in a public fashion. I'd do that kind of a cowering in a in a in a closet or a pantry.

**Laura:**

**Brian:** Nice. So where did the Gator almost get you?

**Mike:** So this was in um, um, Charleston, or on the way to Charleston going, um, we were water skiing, we were going through these waters that became more and more brackish. And um, and so uh, I was skiing and um, and I wiped out, you know, I fell and then, you know, I was there, I was fine and then all of a sudden, you know, boat's way far away and they're turning around and they're coming faster than he should and they're all waving at me. So I'm just waving back and they're pointing and waving, I'm just waving. Um, and uh, they get up there and I can about getting the boat. And so I start freaking out and so I I climb in the boat and I what about the skis and they're like leave them. And I and I get in the boat and I climb and then and uh, you know, look around and then there's, you know, five feet from me, there's an alligator head right there. Alligator, crocodile, I don't know. See, that's me with details. It's what one of those things with big teeth. And so, yeah, I mean it was a few feet from me, so, and it and I and I could tell it looked hungry and I could and I and I was feeling like I was pretty delicious at the time, so I I know it was just about to eat me.

**Brian:** Well, you'd probably be spicy.

**Mike:** Yes, I would. Absolutely.

**Laura:** So I'm going to know under what circumstances George Bush asked about your lunch.

**Mike:** Okay, so it's uh, it's not as uh exciting as it sounds, but um, I was hiking with my brother and dad. This was just out in Waynesville one day. And um, we had uh uh finished and we'd stopped on that main street and went into a McDonald's there. And um, and we didn't realize there was a bunch of hustle and bustle on the streets and it turns out uh W was coming through with his motorcade really slowly. And so we just came out, you know, stay outside McDonald's, I'm holding a Big Mac and uh, and he's like driving by, he's like standing at the entrance of the bus. He's like, hey buddy, how's that Big Mac treating you? So he asked me asked me how my Big Mac was. And so I thought, yeah, I thought that was pretty cool. And that's that is my brush with fame.

**Brian:** Nice.

**Mike:** Yeah, yeah. It's I don't like to brag, but it's pretty impressive.

**Brian:** And a tremendously accurate impersonation as well.

**Mike:** Well, thank you. Yeah, thank you.

**Laura:** Uh, this has been so much fun. Thank you, Mike, for speaking with us today.

**Mike:** Yeah, I know this was fun. I really appreciate that you're doing this. These are really neat uh it's a neat idea for your podcast, so. Thank you, appreciate it.

**Laura:** Thank you. And so for the NDM podcast, I'm Laura Millatella.
