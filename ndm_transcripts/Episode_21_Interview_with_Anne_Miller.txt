The naturalistic decision-making podcast with Brian Moon and Laura Millatello. This podcast series brings you interviews with leading NDM researchers who study and support people who make decisions under stress.

Speaker 1: Welcome to the Naturalistic Decision Making podcast. This is Brian Moon from Perigian Technologies.

Speaker 2: And I'm Laura Millatello from Applied Decision Science.

Speaker 3: Today, we welcome Anne Miller, lead Human Factors researcher and team lead with Cerner Corporation in Kansas City, Missouri, where she develops, supervises and conducts human factors research related to high-risk electronic health care record applications. A highly experienced researcher in the fields of human system integration and human factors in health care. Her research fosa include the role of information technology in supporting resilience in clinical decision-making, clinical communication, and care coordination in complex clinical care context, and translating complex human systems theory and research into application development. Welcome Anne and thank you for joining us.

Speaker 4: Oh, thank you. It's great to be here. It's great to catch up with you folks again.

Speaker 1: Yeah, we definitely uh, we definitely want to catch up and certainly hear about what you're doing today, but I actually want to start by going a bit further back, uh, get you to be somewhat reflective. So you uh, you started your career as a registered nurse in Australia and I'm kind of wondering what led to your shift toward human computer interaction and human factors.

Speaker 4: Well, it wasn't sort of one of these sort of confluence of events. So I'd been, um, I was an intensive care nurse, um, and I had two small children, and, um, basically I guess at the end of the day I was burnt out. And that was burnt out through shift work. This was in the 80s, and there wasn't a lot that the, um, the knowledge about how to structure shift work was really emerging. Um, we were working on some pretty, pretty radical shift patterns, um, in terms of night shift, day shift, afternoon shift. Um, and over a period of time, um, that really, really added up. Um, in addition to that, I'd really gotten as far as I, um, was able to at the time as a bedside nurse. So career opportunities are certainly changed, um, at the late 80s, but in the mid 80s, um, it there were, we're really only three options. You remained at the bedside, you went into, um, nursing administration, or you went into nursing education. And I was really not ready for administration or education, and really had sort of gotten as far as I was, uh, really able to go, um, in, at the bedside. Um, and I was interested in research. I was interested in learning, and I was interested in, um, in in moving beyond or not being stuck in where I was. So, I went and spoke to a, um, a vocational psychologist, who suggested that maybe I might be interested in applied psychology. I then found a degree in applied psych, and, uh, took that up at Monash University in Melbourne. And there I was really fortunate to have a lecturer who's who's, uh, passed away, uh, some years ago now, but his name is uh, Colin Cameron, Professor Colin Cameron. And he was one of the early human factors researchers in Loughborough in the UK. And he was great at telling stories, and he was telling stories about, he told us a lot of stories about, um, how Loughborough was involved, uh, with the Royal Air Force after the Second World War. Um, and these guys were asked by the the Royal Air Force, um, to explain why it was that young pilots seemed to have a, uh, propensity to drive their airplanes into the ground, which sort of seemed like a rather silly thing to do. So, the more he was talking about, um, how the displays of cockpits and, uh, uh, were really, uh, affecting the way that, um, pilots were understanding their orientation in space, the more I started to make linkages between, um, what he was telling me, and some of the equipment that we were working at in the ICUs. Uh, mechanical ventilators, for example, were simply a console of knobs, and they were all exactly the same knobs and they were set up very nicely in about, uh, four rows of about 10 columns of knobs. Um, and using these knobs, we were, um, required to, to manage, uh, ventilatory patterns for these patients. Um, so I started to see the relationship between, um, what he was telling me, um, about his work in human factors and the sort of work that I was doing in the ICU. Information fragmentation, information distribution, um, different kinds of lighting, all of this sort of made a lot of sense. But, at the, in the in the 90s, there really wasn't any health care in human factors, especially not in Australia. Um, and that really, so I found myself, um, doing, uh, human computer interaction in telecommunications. So I really did get out of, uh, out of health care for a little while. And then the seminal report To Err is Human came out from the Institute of Medicine here in the United States. Um, and as another confluence of events, I happened to be attending a human factors conference in Australia. And, uh, started talking to people about, uh, doing, um, uh, doing a PhD. And, uh, having chatted to some folks, uh, met Professor Penny Sanderson, who had just returned from the United States and was very much interested in, uh, getting into health care. So, I was interested in doing a PhD, she was interested in understanding more, more understanding more about health care and that seemed to be the perfect match. And the rest, as they say, is history.

Speaker 1: Right. Yeah, the confluence of events. Uh, it's funny how, um, the different problems that we see in different domains uh, just resonate it to what we're already familiar with. And then your, your story about listening to the cockpit issue, cockpit issues Yeah. being similar to what you had experienced.

Speaker 4: Oh, it was very powerful. Um, his his stories and the connections and saying, hang on a second, I worked on the machine that did exactly the same thing. That was, you mean to tell me that those machines can lead us into into errors, you know, that we can Is that why they're so hard to use? Because, is that why we have to double check them all the time? Not because we're at fault, but because of poor design? Really, that was a revelation. I mean, that was seriously a revelation.

Speaker 1: I'm curious back to that occupational uh, therapist, did uh did they indicate anything in particular that uh they thought was would make you a good match for?

Speaker 4: Well, the first thing that she came up with was, um, nursing. So, so so applied psychology was the second thing on the list, which was kind of funny.

Speaker 1: So, so since those early days, your your career has been marked by roles as a, as you said, a practitioner early on, uh, later a lecturer, a professor, and researcher and and you've been working across two continents. I'm wondering if you can sort of, uh, uh, walk through what you like most and least about each of those roles in and in each continent. So I I don't know that you've, have you practiced medicine in the US?

Speaker 4: No, no. I have not been a, uh, a health care practitioner in the US. I've been fortunate to have spent eight years, um, in the Department of anesthesiology at, um, Vanderbilt University Medical Center working with, uh, Professor Matt Winger and the team down there. But no, I am not I have not been a registered nurse in the United States and I do not practice I have not practiced in the United States. So, however, it was, uh, it was very, um, going into Vanderbilt. So one of the first projects that I did there as a postdoc involved, uh, doing, uh, some observations in the United States. And I swear that the language other than the accents, and other than being referred to as Miss Anne, um, anything else was pretty much, uh, was very, very, very familiar. The language was similar, the technology was similar, the patients were similar, the the ICU layouts were similar. And that kind of, that kind of, um, it all sort of, um, that sort of stands to reason. Um, we tend to read the same kind of textbooks, we go to the same kinds of conferences, we purchase technology from the same vendors. Um, so it's sort of not that surprising, Australia and, uh, the US, uh, similarly, uh, first world countries, um, in terms of education and structures. So, it wasn't really surprising that I didn't find it, uh, too different. It, it was quite similar. Felt very familiar. But, um, as to your other question about, yes, I've definitely moved between an applied role, an academic role, and now an applied role again, and they serve very different functions for me. Um, in the applied world, um, I get to see and get I seem to get access to, um, access to technology, access to the people who build technology, who design technology, who think about how technologies can be put together. But one of the problems and it's certainly one of the challenges that we have, that I have in my current role, is that working in an applied technology focused, um, environment, we have a lot of difficulty getting access to real world environments where we can, um, work directly with, um, the people whom we design the technology for. And in the other, in the other, um, in an academic role, um, particularly at Vanderbilt, um, and also in Australia at, uh, at Monash and University of Queensland, we were, we had enormous access to clinicians. They're right on your front door. But you don't get access to, uh, the builders of technology. The so there's a something of a gap and I've found myself jumping from, um, situations where I have very close contact and easy access to, uh, the people who, um, who who I'm interested in designing technology for, and then jumping into situations where I'm working very closely with the, uh, developers and the builders and the designers of those technologies. And have found that, um, for me that works, it works in the sense that I'm able to take, um, be inspired by the the clinical environment, take that understanding of what people are doing, how they're doing it, the contexts, um, in which they're working and take that into a technological environment such as Cerner, um, and communicate that directly and and have a strong influence on on how people understand that technology in context and then jumping out of that again into the applied world to sort of see how that works. So, that's been, that's that's how it's my career has really worked. It's jumping from a very practical in the world kind of situations, then out into, um, into development in environments, um, back into contexts where I can really hone, uh, research skills and do research, um, from a, from a a purely research perspective, learned those sorts of things and then take them back into into a development environment. That's just sort of the way that I've shaped my career. Others will probably do things very differently.

Speaker 1: It feels like also there's, uh, a lot of opportunity to, uh, or maybe opportunity's not the right word for it, a lot of requirement to sort of bite your tongue in both of those situations. I I was, as I was listening to you talk about, uh, being a researcher, uh, and then observing nurse practice, for instance, I I was sort of imagining you seeing errors about to happen because you sort of know that the direction these things are going, but as a researcher, um, you don't necessarily feel empowered to sort of jump in and and and help correct that direction. Have you, have you had those kinds of experiences where you've you you've been in one role or the other and and you sort of know what the other side looks like, but you need to, you know, for for political and and other reasons to sort of hold back on what you offer?

Speaker 4: Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean, the first the first the first thing, first thing to be said about that is, um, the time that I spent in telecommunications was really important because it changed my identity. Um, prior to that, I very much identified as a nurse. So, if somebody said what do you do, what's your profession, I would say I was a nurse. But in a telecommunications environment, that makes no sense whatsoever. And it's important, it's it's an important part of of changing, of me really getting out of healthcare and really changing my identity. I'm not a nurse anymore, I'm a human computer interaction researcher or I'm a human factors researcher. And then moving further into, um, into a PhD, where I'm and into the applied psych degrees, again, it was fundamental in changing my identity. So when people ask me, who, who, who are you? I'm a human factors researcher and once upon a time in the very, very, very, very very distant past, I used to be a registered nurse, but I'm not anymore. Um, so that helps in terms of going into these environments, I'm not a nurse. I'm not a nurse anymore, and my knowledge base as a nurse, um, in terms of nursing practice is radically out of date. So that to some extent, um, changes the way that I interact with nurses. So, it also gives me the the the the opportunity to suspend what I think. Um, and it makes gives me the permission to ask stupid questions, such as, can you tell me what you're doing now? So, I may think that they're actually going down a pathway that leads them to error, but actually they can come back and tell me that they're actually doing something that has a rational, um, and sensible basis for. So, there are lots of elements to that. First of all is that I may not necessarily that they're going into into into, um, they're they're working towards an error, I may not know that. Um, but if I suspect that, I can ask the naive question, such as, can you tell me what you're doing now? Can you tell me why you're doing that? Can you tell me what you expect to happen as a consequence of that? And that may change, um, a person's, um, understanding of the situation that that they're in. So, this is a naturalistic decision, um, podcast, and you can use those sorts of naturalistic decision cues. Can you tell me what you're attending to? And, um, what is your what is your status in terms of, uh, level one SA, situation awareness? Uh, what's going on at the moment? What does this mean for you? So, you you can ask those situation awareness questions, and even in doing that, um, you you can get that person to stand back and think about what they are doing. Um, whether or not they were going, uh, down an erroneous pathway or not. So, to some extent, there's the opportunity to have people reflect on what they're doing. If I thought they were going down some pathway, but I'm not the expert on that pathway in any case. Uh, so, I'm there as a researcher and not as a clinician.

Speaker 1: Right. Yeah, that uh, that that identity change is, um, it sounds like a really interesting period especially as you come back in, uh, and and you're starting to engage more with the community you're once in, but but having a a very different status if you will.

Speaker 4: and a very different orientation. It's really like putting on a different set of glasses. You're looking at the world through a different, um, set of set of lenses. Um, and I I understand the language of the of of of clinician's language, but I see it these days through a very, very different, um, set of lenses. I don't see it, I don't see the, I don't see the work as a nurse. I see it as a as a human factors researcher. And that's really important. I mean, it was also really important, um, to stand on research principles, especially in the early days, um, as I made that transition, um, and to really think about how I was asking questions, um, and being deliberate about being naive and really asking myself what assumptions am I making about this? Uh, so a lot of, um, of being mindful of what lens I was looking at the world through. Um, and that was kind of difficult in the in coming back into into, um, into health care, um, after being in in the in a telecommunications environment, um, I was very mindful of what lens I was looking at the world through and trying not look at the world from a an ex-nurse's perspective, but rather look at the world from a an HF perspective. And I very much depended on, um, people like my colleagues, um, through my PhD, Penny Sanderson and others to to really challenge, um, my perspectives.

Speaker 1: Yeah, that that's a really hard thing to teach, especially, um, you know, even for knowledge elicitation to, to try to get people to understand that that you're there to elicit the knowledge, you're not necessarily there to question it or, you know, get into a debate. Uh, and and as I was doing some knowledge management work in organizations, I I sort of went back and forth as to whether it's better to have someone within the organization do the knowledge elicitation or someone from the outside. because it's a lot easier coming from the outside to ask those naive questions and get interesting responses and, uh, but but, um, but if you're in the organization or or you have experience in the domain, uh, I imagine there's a, a fair amount of of learning about yourself, uh, and sort of what the purpose is of your activity to sort of work through as part of your as part of your training. Uh, so so that you don't, so you don't get yourself into those situations where you're you're having a debate with the expert about what the right thing to do is.

Speaker 4: Yeah, that's not your role. Uh, it's not my role to debate. Um, it's my role to to understand and clarify the intention of what they've said and to understand why they might think that, but it's not my role to debate that or even to question it.

Speaker 1: Yeah, or or even to learn because, you know, while while you may need to get familiar and and understand the context and understand the as you said before, the sort of rationale for the decisions, you're not there to really learn them. You're not there to become the expert. And that's a that's a very subtle distinction in this knowledge elicitation that I think takes a while for people to pick up on, especially if you're trying to train people in the organization.

Speaker 4: Yeah, yeah. Um, they they contextual inquiry and I find that a very, um, an effective method for data, uh, data collection. But, um, sometimes and and one of the tenants of that is, you know, a human master apprentice role, uh, where the person that you're working with is the master and and you give yourself permission and you ask them to give you permission to be an apprentice. Um, and I think as far as that goes to your point, you know, yeah, that's that's there's a point at which no, you're not learning the job. You're there to understand the work, but you're not there to be an apprentice. Um, so that model to some extent breaks down. I understand, and I do see the value in, um, gaining some sort of permission to ask naive questions and for somebody to give you a fairly extended or comprehensive answer. Um, but it's not really about learning their job. It's understanding the work and understanding the interactions in the work. Um, and I think Ed Hutchen's, um, in his his book, you know, the cognition in the wild, does a great job at really drawing that distinction between understanding the work and learning the work.

Speaker 1: Yeah, it it takes a while, but, um, uh, I found that the best researchers, once they get to that point, once they sort of have that insight, uh, things become a lot easier for them.

Speaker 4: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, for sure. Data becomes a lot easier to analyze too.

Speaker 2: Right. Yeah. So hey, Anne, I wanted to ask you, you have all this experience, you worked in an ICU. I know you've done lots of research in ICU settings. And right now ICUs are all in the news, right? We're all concerned about, um, just being overloaded and I I just I wondered if you have any insights about work in the ICU that are particularly relevant, um, in terms of adaptiveness or risk that are particularly relevant right now as we're experiencing this global pandemic.

Speaker 4: Oh, okay. Um, I know, that's a big question. It is a big question. It's it's sort of sort of a case of where do you start and from what perspective? In a lot of ways ICU work is actually very simple. You're really dealing with three basic things, which is airway, breathing, and circulation. That's what ICU is about. It's an extended, it's a place, um, it's a place of resuscitation. Um, the idea is to do whatever it takes to maintain an airway, do whatever it takes to maintain breathing, and do whatever it takes to maintain circulation because if you don't have any of those three, you don't have a live patient. Those are the, those are the key elements and most of ICU care, not all of it, is geared to that, certainly in the general ICU. You also get specialist ICUs that deal with, um, specialist, uh, conditions such as neurological care or burns ICU or, um, medical, surgical, cardio, cardio thoracic, um, that have particular, um, um, subspecialties in ICU. But even in those environments, you're maintaining, um, airway, breathing and circulation. So from that point of view, things are pretty simple. Um, it's dealing with all of the factors that, um, threaten those three things. So, sepsis, infection, dealing with minimizing or treating infection so that you can maintain effective circulation. Um, minimizing, um, brain swelling in in the case of head injuries, that, um, can, uh, negatively affect your breathing and and some parts of your circulation. It's trying to take away the causes of those threats, or those threats, um, to those three, um, areas. Um, the other thing about, so so, in a lot of ways ICU is is sort of pretty simple in in it's overall, in the overall objectives or overall goals. Um, the other part of it is, um, continuity, um, is also a factor in ICUs. The rate of change in ICU patients can be very, very rapid. So where, um, in in a chronic or in an out patient environment and other medical settings, patient change occurs over extended periods of time, and often you don't notice it. So, particularly in terms of chronic health until there's a crash, until you get to some sort of a tipping point. In ICU, that time frame, that long bit of time is contracted. So, the time horizons over which you're looking are often hours, um, minutes to hours to days. Uh, so keeping track of those things, um, can sometimes be challenging, but you're less likely to get some of the discontinuity issues, and I say that as a broad generalization, that's not always true. Um, very rewarding in the ICU, um, because you also, as much as you get rapid deterioration, you get rapid improvement at the same time. So, you deal with the the depths and the heights of, well, this patient is really getting better, this is really cool. We've managed to get this patient's blood pressure to be maintained at this level and we've managed to turn down all the support for that, that, we've done a really, really great job, that's really cool. So, a lot of the feedback about, um, your performance is also really, um, rewarding in that sense. Um, it's high-paced, um, you get to work together as a team, um, the support in an ICU amongst, um, staff, um, other nurses, um, other members of the interdisciplinary team tends to be fairly strong, so a strong sense of teamwork, um, and shared experience. Um, those things really stand out for me. Both from my past, they're the things that I remember about working as an ICU nurse, and also the things that I often see in terms of ICUs. Does that answer your question?

Speaker 2: Yeah, thanks for that reflection, and it kind of makes sense based on what you're describing that, um, during this period of, uh, COVID as we're seeing, you know, uh, lots and lots of people in the hospital, that these are the folks who are really experiencing burnout. given the intensity that you're describing, the connection with the patients, the teamwork, all of that.

Speaker 4: And in the COVID, this, in a normal ICU, you get variations. So you get, um, you might have one or two patients who are really, really sick, um, a couple of patients that you might be observing, a couple of patients who are nearly ready to be discharged, um, from the ICU. So you get a lot of variation in in where patients are at in their journey through the ICU. With COVID, my sense of the COVID situation and I've not been in it, um, is that it's unrelenting. It's just unrelenting. Um, it's one patient, the next patient, the next patient, the next patient, the next patient. Um, and it's just unrelenting. Um, it's full on, full go all the time. And, um, while you may have, um, situations where you get, um, a run on certain, you know, certain issues, beginning of winter, you get lots of car accidents, so you get a run on car accidents. But it's, um, short-lived, it's not ongoing and ongoing and when are we going to see the end of this? So, I really empathize with, um, clinicians who are currently working in these environments, uh, trying to maintain morale, trying to maintain, um, a sense of, um, perspective, trying to get some time out and, you know, downtime from what seems to be just an unrelenting onslaught of COVID patients. Um, very, very difficult to deal with.

Speaker 2: Yeah, and I I think I think we are seeing that in spite of all these challenges, these folks are, um, remarkably resilient. Like, they keep coming back.

Speaker 4: Well, um, it's I think that remains to be seen, you know. Um, that you can't you can't work at this pace indefinitely. Um, and coping strategies. Uh, resilience resilience is an interesting kind of a concept. Um, I once asked, there's a a concept in in medicine called physiological reserve. Um, it's a little bit like the concept of resilience. And, um, I asked the physician once to explain to me what physiological reserve was. And he said, well, put your put your arm out. Stick your arm out at right angles to your body and just leave it there. Just sit there and leave it there, and leave it there, and leave it there, and leave it there. And, um, it's it's going to get tired after a little while and you can change your position and sort of wiggle your wrist around, but just leave your arm there and leave it there, and leave it there, and leave it there. And eventually, um, your muscles get so tired that you can't leave it there anymore. And that's a measure of that is, that's what physiological reserve is. It's the time and the effort between putting your arm up and when your arm actually collapses and you can't do it any further. And resilience is a little bit like that. We kind of have a have a unless we can renew it and unless we can maintain that that kind of, um, buffer of, um, capacity to respond, eventually we burn out and we crash. So, how resilient people are, they're not indefinitely resilient. How we how we try to provide opportunities or mechanisms for maintaining that buffer, so that people can dip into it, um, that's the challenge.

Speaker 2: Hmm, so that feels like a really important insight that, um, that the health system itself needs to figure out how to do that, how to create that buffer.

Speaker 4: Yeah, yeah, and some of it is in things like shift work, some of it is in reducing stresses and this is where electronic health records can certainly, um, play a role. Uh, to what extent are they contributing, um, to to burnout, um, or that don't provide those, uh, signals that say, hey, you're doing a good job, which is can also be an important part of resilience, just knowing that okay, we're getting on top of this. We can deal with this, we can handle this. Um, how do electronic health records contribute to these situations? How can we design these in ways that, um, can help minimize some of that stress without substituting one stresser for another stressor. Uh, so those are the things that I get interested in at the moment.

Speaker 2: Cool. So that actually leads me to my next question. Can you tell us a little bit about your current role at Cerner?

Speaker 4: Sure. So, um, I'm a lead human factors researcher, so I manage a team of, um, other human factors researchers, and I work very closely with, um, UX design, uh, team members or colleagues and, um, developers. And the area of interest that or the area of my responsibility in in relation to, um, the record is what we call chart review. So those are all of those functions in the electronic record that contribute to physicians being able to figure out what this patient's story currently is. So, things like patient assessments, uh, things like, um, understanding where this patient has come from, what the status of this patient is right now, and potentially where they're going to go into the future. So, all of that, uh, assessment, situational awareness, I am up to my eyeballs in that. And so we are doing, hopefully have a paper out next year looking at, um, how how clinicians extract meaning from different kinds of, um, laboratory test, uh, displays. Uh, that's a a little project that we have going at the moment. Um, but we're also looking at things such as, um, how does the problem list actually figure into patient assessments? Um, how is the problem list used across an interdisciplinary team? Um, what information actually should be included with that? What are the contexts in which the problem list might be used, um, both inpatient and outpatient? So, that's sort of, uh, gives you some sense of the scope of my work at the moment.

Speaker 2: Wow. And so what that makes me think of is it's several years back now, you and I wrote a book chapter together. And at that time you were talking about and thinking about how do how does the health care team get that story of the patient together and what supports it and what doesn't?

Speaker 4: Yes.

Speaker 2: So, this is something you've been thinking about for a long time.

Speaker 4: Oh, absolutely. Been thinking about this for for a very long time. I guess and the the sort of the addendum to that book chapter is, okay, we that that was written, uh, while I was at Vanderbilt, Right. And we did off a lot of the research that we did there. And now I have the opportunity to start to communicate that research in a practical way to my colleagues and to use the, uh, the knowledge gained then to start to think about how how that informs solutions.

Speaker 2: Yeah, I was thinking what an awesome position you're in now to actually influence change, not just highlight the problem but to think about how we can really address it. That is really cool, Anne.

Speaker 4: Yeah, and we're sort of starting to do introduce other sorts of techniques such as, so this uh lab review, um, or lab, um, details study that we did, um, we analyzed that using signal detection, for example. Um, we also looked at strategy. Uh, how do how do clinicians, um, group information? Uh, that was a that was a finding that came out of it that we weren't expecting. So, we're really excited about, uh, that sort of work. Um, but it's, um, it's been, it's been great to see how and and our designers are really good with this. You can, um, I'm not a designer. I'm not somebody who has the ability to take a concept and visualize it and create a visualization for it. But I work with hugely talented people who do do that. So I can say, here's a problem and our we work with physicians as well, and as a team, we can define, um, a problem, but, um, our design team can can actually visualize that in many different ways, which then gives us the opportunity to test different things. So, this is really cool, you know, being able to work with these guys who can, um, come up with these prototypes and uh, you know, clickable prototypes that you can put in front of clinicians at really short notice. This is this is really cool. This is really good. Totally enjoying this. That is awesome.

Speaker 1: Yeah.

Speaker 4: And then to be able to share it back with them, you know, say say talk about, um, this is how this design really supports perception, you know? Um, this is where perception falls down. One of the things that we found is that people really in if you give them, um, a set of lab values and a very limited time frame such as 15 seconds to review this, what do they focus on? Um, they focus on the abnormals. But if you color the abnormals red versus uh for, um, abnormally high versus blue for abnormally low, is there a difference in in how, um, and how they perceive those, um, elements? And it turns out amongst our participants that yes, there was. They gravitate towards the red, not the blue. Um, and so from a signal detection point of view, we had lots of false alarms that were red and lots of misses that were blue. So, that starts to change the way we think about, well, how are we going to communicate our abnormals? Does that change our design standards? Hmm, maybe we need to do repeat the study. So, I mean, these things make a real difference. You know, this makes a difference and and that blows my mind.

Speaker 2: Yeah, that's that's really cool, Anne. Um, and I love that you're in the position you are. Um, because, uh, you know, it's the synergy, right? You need the creative skilled designers but you also need the the scientist mind that can ask those questions and and say just because we saw this once is that enough? Maybe we should look at this, you know, recruit some more people and make sure the effect, um, stands up. Um,

Speaker 4: Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2: Yeah. Exactly. Which is what we and we're doing that follow-up study. I've got my last participant this afternoon for the follow-up study on that. So, I haven't started crunching the numbers on it yet, but I we'll we're looking forward to being able to, uh, to communicate this to the broader, um, to the to the broader world because it was a a quasi experimental design. So, we're not giving away trade secrets. Um, it's pure pure old research. It's great. And and I'm very, very fortunate to work for an organization that doesn't have any problem with that.

Speaker 1: Yeah. That's one, that's wonderful. So so you're learning new things, um, but but but I I was fortunate enough since since Laura brought up her uh co-publication, I'll go ahead and drop one of my own. Uh, I I I was fortunate enough to uh to have you invite me to participate in a uh sort of of a meta-analysis of qualitative research in healthcare, uh, and also some design guidance documents for, uh, clinical decision support. And so you're learning new stuff now, but you and the community sort of have been at this for a while and we know a lot about what works and what probably doesn't work. Uh, and we we've we've put together these, you know, everything from articles to treatisess and guidance documents and those sorts of things. I'm kind of wondering what what your personal experience has been in getting feedback about those, uh, you know, those guidance types of documents. Um, what kind of feedback have you gotten from the various communities that you that you work in?

Speaker 4: That paper that you're talking about seems to be referenced an awful lot. So, uh, that's which is nice. I think that's that's the same one. Anyway, um, so probably not so much feedback about those directly, um, indirectly. I think one of the things that really surprises the the one of the blind spots that you have as an academic researcher is that you really don't know what the challenges are with the technology itself. So, you sort of as an academic researcher, you publish these papers and you say, well, why doesn't anybody take this up? I mean, this is really obvious. This is really, you know, come on guys. What's the story here? And, um, you get into these tech these these these big corporate environments. And things, there are technological limitations. Um, there are issues of migration, such as, um, legacy systems that need to be, um, uplifted to modern technology. And it's those constraints within the legacy systems that mean that and there are a whole variety of them, you know, there are huge, um, variety of just constraints in the in the technology. Yes, it can do wonderful, wonderful things. Um, but it's also very constrained in a lot of ways. Um, and the technology is moving. So, where do we actually implement this? What do we do about, um, systems that are that are older or versions that are still out there that haven't been upgraded. Um, so understanding what the the the nexus is between, yeah, it's great that we could do these research this research and we can come up with these really cool guidelines. But, are they implementable? You know, can we implement these things? What is it going to take to implement these things? Where should we implement these things? Um, that's a whole different ball game and in the big scheme of things, what's the priority for implementing these things? So, it becomes a, yeah, you you you look at, you look at the research that we've done and say, yeah, that's what we need to do, but how do we implement that? How do we actually get it done? Um, so, it it it's somewhat challenging. Yes.

Speaker 1: So is this just a case of, um, of sort of nacent, uh, you know, emerging fields and findings being way out in front of of the lagging systems. Um, and so if if we carry that forward in in 10, 20 years, are we going to see the systems that, um, we're suggesting be designed? Are we going to see them implemented?

Speaker 4: I think the hope I think is that we're we're coming up with systems and development processes. The two aren't separated. There's there's not only the the capability of the technology but also the the development processes. Um, that, uh, the hold the promise of being able to implement changes a lot more adaptively, a lot more flexibly and a lot more and a lot a lot more quickly, a lot faster. Um, whether that's a good thing or not, given the propensity towards unintended consequences, um, I'm not sure. So, certainly in in uplifting from old, um, legacy systems to say cloud-based systems, the promise is that we should be able to, um, implement change much more rapidly and have it distributed through the cloud a lot more, um, a lot faster. In safety critical environments, is that necessarily a good thing? Hmm. We put recommendations out there, but when we put guidelines out there, what we're really putting out there is a hypothesis. We hypothesize that if you follow this guideline, that, um, more good things will happen than bad things, but they're still hypotheses and they're still guidelines. Um, they're not an absolute truth. The context can change. Um, so maybe we're substituting one set of problems for another set of problems. Um, I'm not sure that we're going to be out of a job anytime soon. So, yeah, it it sort of remains to be seen. You know, the process changes that are occurring even in the way that we develop systems. Um, do they always lead to good outcomes? There's a lot of talk about agile and agile processes. Um, agile processes as I'm sure you're very aware, are really designed for development. Where does, um, human factors work fit into that? How does it fit into that? Again, um, it's the way that Cerner has, um, has, um, worked to implement, um, that, uh, that that whole process is to really have very long discovery and, um, pre-agile phases. And so that once we, once we come up with, um, um, a solution that we've evaluated, that we've researched, that we've designed, that we hand that off to development, and at that point the development becomes an agile process to implement the design that we've, um, that we we hand over. Um, having worked through several, um, different companies that have tried to implement agile, this by far has been the most successful in my humble opinion. Where we do get those opportunities to to do discovery work to it to put that into various different design, um, solutions, to undertake formative evaluations on those and to iterate those designs, um, before we hand it off to developers rather than trying to do, um, human factors, human computer interaction type work right in the middle of development. Um, nobody seems to be happy with that. I haven't been happy with that approach in the past.

Speaker 1: So, so to bring this a bit back to the NDM focus, I'm wondering now and you've mentioned a couple of uh folks along the ray with I'm wonder if you can offer just a few people that have kind of influenced, not just your maybe your NDM, uh sensibilities, but just general, uh, approach and and how you go about thinking about your work.

Speaker 4: Um, I definitely have to hat off to, uh, to Laura Mellatelo and Gary Klein and, um, that whole cohort hugely influential on my work. Um, and the numerous discussions, um, that we've had and that includes you too, Brian. You've been involved in some of those conversations. So conversations with the NDM, um, uh, community have have been incredibly influential in the way that I see the world, the way I understand my work and the way I understand what, um, my priorities as a human factors researcher are. Um, so I have to give huge amounts of credit to to you guys. Other people that have been very influential, um, on me would be Eric Hollnagel and, um, Dave Woods. Um, for introducing those ideas of resilience. Um, for changing the way that I understand safety, one of the biggest, um, shifts in health care, um, IT has been the European Union's, um, regulations on or regulation that determines that electronic health records are medical devices. Um, and so now we think about safety like hugely. We undertake hazard analysis. But the the thing that, um, Hollnagel and Woods, uh, really emphasize is not so much the the the hazards part of it, but the safety to elements of it, which really start to change the way that you look at design to say how do we actually enhance safety more than just mitigating hazards. Um, that's been hugely influential in the way that I talk about, uh, safety, um, in my work and to my colleagues and to my team members as well is that, you know, let's let's yes, let's mitigate the hazards, absolutely, definitely, let's mitigate the hazards, but how do we actually improve safety? Um, and that's a different conversation. Um, and it's a very productive conversation. So, those guys have been really influential in my work. And I also have to, um, acknowledge people like Penny Sanderson, my, um, the the folks that I still keep in touch with, um, from my PhD for actually setting me up for a lot of this for this sort of work. Um, for Penny's insistence that, um, as Australians, we need to get off the island. There's a whole world out there that we really need to re to experience, um, and engage with. Um, her her, uh, her her, um, motivation, um, to move out of Australia, the confined of, um, a small country, um, like Australia, uh, to a bigger world, was also massively influential, um, in in terms of my career path.

Speaker 2: I have kind of a, uh, shifting gears question here a little bit. I'm wondering, let's I want you to imagine that you meet a complete stranger who claims to practice naturalistic decision-making. On pain of death, you're given one question to determine if they do indeed practice NDM. What do you ask?

Speaker 4: I think I'd be asking what questions, if you were to go and speak to a clinician or a, um, a a a person whom you were interested in studying, what are the types of questions that you you ask them? Um, and the sort of answers that I would know an NDM person, um, because they ask somebody to tell them stories, um, about the kind of work, you know, critical critical incidents, um, or critical, um, encounters that they've been personally engaged in. So, they have some understanding of CDM, pretty, uh, critical decision method. Um, that they also are very much focused not on what people do, not on the behaviors of what people do, but how people approach the problem cognitively. Um, how they make sense of the world that they're working in, how they, um, the nature of the information that they capture, um, how that information is turned into sort of strategies, thinking about things like, um, feedback, but certainly storytelling is a big part, I think of, um, NDM. And being able to take a story apart, be able to, you know, sort of pull out the the the flow of events, but also the the various using that story as a as a as a as a jumping off point to really explore the the world that that person works in. And I'm somewhat biased because I certainly work in, um, in in in an industry where cognition and information work is really the dominant nature of the work. So, in other in other environments, um, the focus may be different, but storytelling I think is a big, um, part of NDM.

Speaker 2: I love that answer. I think, um, especially because I mean, you live in a world where people use all kinds of techniques to try to understand work. Um, and there are lots of good techniques, but but I do think that idea of getting people to tell stories and then unpack that story, um, is so powerful.

Speaker 4: Oh, absolutely. Um, Gary's book in that first couple of chapters about, um, and, you know, um, the power of intuition, um, where he talks about, uh, firefighters and and sitting in the in the fire in the station, the fire station, um, with time on their hands and getting them to tell stories and his ability to listen and unpack those systematically and methodically without dehumanizing those stories in any way. I think it's really, really powerful and a great, um, and a great, uh, intro to naturalistic decision-making. Ed Hutchen's stories too about, um, how people use, um, uh, artifacts, um, in distributed cognition, the role of those artifacts that takes, um, that takes what's in people's heads out and puts it in the world and how the world and the people interact. I think is really, um, really is is really clever, um, and very insightful.

Speaker 1: All right, we're down to our last and final question and it is one that we've asked others and Laura is so much better at this game than I am, but we're going to try it again. We'd like you to tell us two truths about yourself and one lie and we are going to try to guess the lie.

Speaker 4: Okay, I I I notice this you you sent me a sort of a guideline or you warned me that I would be asked this question. So I had to think very hard about how what, um, what I how I was going to answer this. Um, so I've sort of hit my the question that this is the answer to is what skills to what COVID skills have you learned, what learned skills have you learned, um, while you've been in COVID lockdown? So, here are my three skills, two of them are truths and one of them is a lie. My first skill is that I've been slowly working my way through Bach's preludes and fugues on the piano because there was a piano in the house that we bought and we paid 50 bucks for it. Um, my second skill is that, um, I've learned to um, how to be how to do some stonemasonry with dry stone walling and my third skill, um, because I'm an avid cyclist is I've also learned how to be a bike mechanic. Two of those are truths and one of them is a lie.

Speaker 1: That is such a brilliant way to back on us. Laura's cheating because she would often know these intimate details about people that that that I wouldn't know, and so she uses those against me. But this is this is this is even ground here.

Speaker 2: Yeah. So are you going to go first, Brian?

Speaker 1: No, no way I'm not going first. You go first.

Speaker 2: Okay, I know you've been an avid bicyclist forever and so I'm I believe you've always been a bike mechanic. I'm going to guess that's the lie and the new skills are the piano playing and the stonemasonry. That's my guess.

Speaker 4: You are absolutely correct.

Speaker 1: That was often my gut.

Speaker 4: I haven't played the piano for since I was in high school and this piano was here because I just, it's not an instrument that you can put in your pocket and carry around. Um, so, you know, I should have learned the flute or something like that. So I've, um, picked up Bach preludes and fugues and I'm now up to the D major one. Um, and we've been and I did learn some stonemasonry because we've got a, uh, we had some, uh, some retaining walls that were completely collapsing and they were dry stone walls. So we ended up with the stonemason in there, but he he he he was his thing is teaching people how to do this. So, um, we had two, he came across he came up from um Kansas. Um, and uh we rebuilt these walls and so now I have my little stonemason's hammer and my bell-shaped hammer and my chisel and we chisel out retaining walls, but no one, not a bike mechanic. So I do ride a bike, but I leave the mechanics to the mechanics.

Speaker 2: So Brian, what were you going to guess?

Speaker 1: I I was actually going to guess that one as well because I knew a bit about the cycling, but, um, but yeah, it sounds like, uh, it sounds like you're keeping busy then with all the moves and the new roles and, uh, and and building walls. So, it was great to catch up with you, Anne, and, uh, with that, uh, thank you so much for speaking with us today.

Speaker 4: And thank you so much for inviting me. It's been a delightful conversation and I always love talking to you fellows, you know that.

Speaker 1: We do, and that's why we invited you. Uh, so on on that note, uh, for the NDM podcast, I'm Brian Moon.

Speaker 2: And I'm Laura Millatello. Learn more about naturalistic decision-making and where to follow us by visiting naturalistic decisionmaking.org.
