**Speaker 1:** The Naturalistic Decision Making podcast with Brian Moon and Laura Milatella. This podcast series brings you interviews with leading NDM researchers who study and support people who make decisions under stress.

**Speaker 2:** Welcome to the Naturalistic Decision Making podcast. This is Brian Moon from Pairgy Technologies.

**Speaker 3:** And I'm Laura Milatella from Applied Decision Science.

**Speaker 2:** We are very excited today to welcome Colonel Larry Shaddock. Colonel Shaddock is senior lecturer and director of the Human Systems Integration program at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterrey, California. Dr. Shaddock holds a faculty appointment in the Operations Research department where he teaches Human Systems Integration and Human Factors engineering.

**Speaker 2:** Colonel Shaddock graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1976 and following a distinguished service as a signal officer and receiving his PhD from the Ohio State University in Cognitive Engineering, he returned to his alma mater to teach engineering psychology until his retirement from the Army in 2005. He's been at NPS since where he co-directs the Human Systems Integration program. Larry has been an active researcher in the domain of military Command and Control for nearly two decades. He is unique among his peers in the NDM community for his ability to draw on deep operational experience when studying processes such as how commanders communicate their intent, the manner in which decision makers fuse data in tactical environments, and the ways in which data and information flow through technological system elements to the human agents in that system. Welcome Larry and thank you very much for joining us.

**Speaker 4:** Well, thanks so much for having me, Brian and Laura. It's good to talk with you guys again. It's been a while.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, it has. Uh, and we are very excited to uh bring you into the uh Indian podcast. Uh I want to sort of pick up on the uh the item there in the introduction with regard to your new unique background. I'm just wondering if you can kind of share with us how having such a, you know, deep operational experience has benefited your research and if maybe you can share specific examples of of how you've drawn on your operational research to inform your findings.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, I'd be glad to do that. So, if I go back to probably about 1982, I was a captain in Germany. I was a signal officer in an air defense artillery battalion and the uh unit was getting some new equipment. So they were going to combine the communications shelter with the air defense artillery control shelter, which seemed like a good idea at the time, um but what happened was when we got the new equipment and the air defense person and the signal person were in the same shelter at the same time and the signal person had to do what's called a loop back on that system, the signal person had to lie on the floor on uh on his or her stomach under the feet of the air defense operator, reached behind a rack of communications equipment and blindly uh take hold of a cable and uh remove it from one uh fastener and put it on another fastener to to conduct this uh loop back to test the communications equipment. And it did not take me long to figure out that that was a really, really bad design. Uh, I didn't know anything about human factors at the time at all because I had never been exposed to it. But uh when I was asked to come back to West Point uh to teach engineering psychology, uh after I figured out what engineering psychology was and reflecting back on that experience in 1982, I said, I'm all in. Uh, and so that was a chance for me to, um, to then begin to use my military domain uh knowledge to figure out uh what designs work and what designs won't uh didn't work. So, the other thing that uh my military career has given me the ability to do when I want to do research is access to practitioners. So, where in the uniform, I get a chance to talk the same language and be in the same uh organizations as people that are doing this stuff. And and I've also had the exact same training that that senior officers had. I've been to Commander Jones Staff College, I've been to the Army War College, so I can spot pretty easily when someone is deviating from that, uh that training and that education that they've received. So, it helps me quite a bit. Uh, I I don't have to, you know, sort of bootstrap myself up and learn about the domain because I'm already have been immersed in that domain.

**Speaker 2:** Right. Did do you find with regard to what you just said about deviations, do you find that um those deviations can be both negative and positive and and in the sense that they might be deviating for good uh contextual reasons and so that may lead to feedback on the actual procedures and and SOPs and that sort of thing. Is is that the kind of deviation that you're talking about?

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, typically the military folks are creative and innovative and that's a great thing. Sometimes they just do things that that are not really helpful. I've got a great example of just reflecting on uh a Brigade commander that I was uh given the privilege of observing and it was when the Army had begun its digitizing of the brigade. So, all the systems were becoming digital systems and we're getting away from analog and paper and all that sort of stuff. And so, this particular commander believed that it was in his best interest to take all of the feeds from all of the different systems, the Intel system and the maneuver system and the fire support system, uh, and and the personnel system and the logistics system. And so, he created essentially a wall of televisions in front of him and he sat there in front of that screen and I I watched him and I talked with him to try to figure out what he was doing and he was trying to do essentially the work of all of his staff officers that uh that were essentially analyzing, fusing the information for him and then giving him a distilled version of that battle picture. He was trying to do that all himself and and eventually it did not take him too long to figure out that that was just not going to work for him. So, he rearranged his talk, his Tactical Operations Center and set it up where uh he was able to use, to leverage the expertise of his staff officers to get the information that he needed to make the decision that he should have made. So, uh that's an example of of uh something that will, you know, was a a poor use of the technology, but there are others other examples I have that where they used it pretty effectively.

**Speaker 2:** Right. So, so you mentioned before sort of uh your initial experience of the person under the under the other person and and that sort of uh you look back on that as a it sounds like kind of a first instance of realizing that there's there's better ways to do things. Can you talk to us sort of how you made that uh shift from there's probably better ways to do it to engineering psychology is one way to learn out uh learn how to do these sorts of things? Was that a uh a gradual sort of shift to the field or or did you immediately go searching for a home?

**Speaker 4:** So, about that time or shortly thereafter, West Point reached out to me and said, hey, would you like to come back and and teach for uh us at the behavioral science and leadership department? And I said, that sounds great. And what do you want me to study? And they said, we want you to study engineering psychology. And after I figured out what that was, they said, uh, I said, well, would you like me to go to school? And they said, well, you pick a school. So, uh, I looked at the various uh schools that were offering human factors programs and selected uh Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, went there and got a uh Master's degree in human factors psychology and then returned to West Point and taught there for three years. That was from 1985 to 1988. And then wrapped up that assignment, went to Command and General Staff College, um, went to uh Germany and uh deployed to Desert Shield, Desert Storm, and then in the middle of the the the desert there, um, just after the war had concluded, uh, they reached out to me, West Point reached out to me again and said, would you like to come back in a permanent position uh at what they call an academy professor position. Uh, and I looked around at all the sand around me and I said, that sounds like a great way to spend uh several years of my career. And so that's uh when I applied to uh Ohio State and got accepted there and got introduced to uh cognitive systems engineering and naturalistic decision making uh at at Ohio State.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, so it's really all happening at once for you. You're seeing the operational pieces, you're going to the classroom and learning about it and then you're trying to figure out how to teach it. It sounds like uh, yeah, just just a very interesting mix of experiences that gives you a pretty privileged position. Um, I I first met you when uh we were working together on the Army Research Laboratory's advanced decision architecture program. Uh, and I'm wondering uh if you could sort of share some memories from your long-term involvement in the program and and kind of looking back in what ways you think the program helped advance NDM. I mean, there were a lot of NDM researchers on the program and so it was it was pretty important. I think for advancing just the field generally, but I'm wondering if you can share some of your recollections.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, that was a great time. I I look back with lots of fond memories about that. What you may not recall or remember is that, um, uh collaborative technologies Alliance, the ADA Collaborative Technologies Alliance was uh preceded by something called uh Fed Lab, the Federated Laboratories. That was also an Army Research Lab uh established uh research portfolio. And so, uh when I got back to West Point in 1995, I connected pretty quickly with the folks at uh at Aberdeen and Army Research Lab Human Research and Engineering Directorate and we bring the cadets down there uh on an every other year basis uh to walk around and and talk with those folks. So, I was probably the one of the very few people, if maybe the only person in uniform that had a human factors cognitive engineering degree uh and and was doing what I was doing in terms of teaching and research. So, uh they welcomed me into uh the Fed Lab program where I got a chance to hang out uh with folks like Chris Wickens and Art Kramer and Roger Perelman. Uh, and to, um, come alongside them and and sort of be that, I hate to call myself a military expert because I'm not, but I was I was seen as a subject matter expert because I was the only guy walking around in a uniform uh, who had operational experience. And so when the Fed Lab ended and the uh, uh advanced decision decision architectures uh consortium stood up, uh, I actually was part of the team that selected that group of uh researchers that would eventually become the ADA, the CTA. And uh, there were about five or six submissions uh and when the selection was made, it was pretty much unanimous that we would go with the one that was essentially, you know, cognitive engineering and uh NDM heavy team. And it was like a dream team. I mean, working with with all those folks back then was just incredible. So, uh just to rattle off a couple names and not to leave anybody out, but folks like, um, David Woods who was my PhD advisor, Gary Klein, Robert Hoffman, Nancy Cook, uh, Microanalysis and Design folks like uh Sue Watcher and Ron Locker and other folks like uh Mike Ensley and her team from SA Technologies and folks from Penn State and Carnegie Melon and and uh New Mexico State. It was just an incredible group of folks and I got to work alongside them and to provide the context for them in terms of, okay, what is it that actually happens in a in a Brigade Tactical Operations Center or a battalion Tactical Operations Center. And I got to teach them things like what's the difference between a Scot a squad and a Brigade or division and you know, here's the rank of a of a of a private first class and here's the rank of a of a colonel and and it was kind of fun doing that, but I was the guy that would would sort of green them up and let them know what they needed to know about the military context.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, as as someone who was just sort of entering the field at the time, it was it you're absolutely right. It was sort of the dream team and and it's a heck of a way to to start to cut your teeth on all this uh NDM stuff. But, um, I I'm wondering did just if you can share maybe an example or two of of ways that you thought that program was kind of instrumental in in in NDM generally, but uh also in providing the NDM benefit to the Army. Do any examples kind of stand out for you?

**Speaker 4:** So, I think the thing that came out of that in my mind more than anything else was the synergy that uh emerged when you put all those really, really well-known, well-respected researchers working on the on a project together. And they were each of them had their own individual projects, but we came together twice a year to I think I seemed to remember it was about twice a year typically in Boulder, Colorado where Microanalysis and Design was located and they would all present kind of what they'd been working on and then there was sort of that give and take and feedback and encouragement and and sort of, you know, correction and course correction sort of stuff. So, and that I think went on for about eight years. I think it was a five year with a a couple two or three years added on to the end for good measure uh and to have that group of people together in the same room a couple times a year was pretty exciting. I I remember we did an offsite after one of the meetings, uh and I think it was Robert Hoffman who may have set it up and I got invited and I felt honored to be invited, but they were going to work on the grand unified theory for cognitive engineering. And um, I I just remember to this day looking around the room and seeing all the people that were there and then watching them interact with each other. It was absolutely fascinating to see them um, you know, sort of expouse their view and then there was push back and and and discussion and so forth. Uh, and I'm not sure that anything actually concrete in terms of a grand unified theory emerged out of that, but it was the collaboration that they engaged in and uh that I think was really one of the great benefits of of of that particular consortium. And I sort of look on that maybe in some sense as as a golden age of uh NDM and cognitive engineering because you had all these people with uh, you know, this great amount of expertise working together. Typically, without something like that, we sort of work on our things separately, but there's not that unifying, um, uh, uh function there that exists that the consortium provided.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, I know, I think that's uh that's a great way to think of it. I I another piece that uh would be interesting to hear you talk about is is not only sort of getting all the big brains NDM uh in the same room, but the whole other focus of that program was of course getting the computer science folks uh and the Indian folks to sort of work together or at least uh come together and have discussions. Um, did did you uh recall that as being an important part of of the experience too?

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, absolutely. There were folks from uh Microanalysis and Design as well as and they they had a a software program. I think it was called Jerble. And then there was the sore folks from uh Carnegie Melon, Penn State, uh and I yeah, I don't recall whether there was the sort of the seamless interaction between them that I think that the uh folks that had envisioned the advanced decision architectures, you know, had hoped for. But again, the communication and the discussion back and forth I think was really interesting and and I I know that I remember that there was discussion among folks as to whether or not when you're trying to take NDM and turn it into a software program, do you have to be literal about how you do that or are you trying to, you know, represent, you know, the way our neurons fire and things like that and and out of that, I think came some ideas about how to push uh that uh that sort of computer the computer science version of that forward a little bit. Uh, and I I haven't checked in with that in in a while, so I'm not exactly sure what kind of progress they made in all that.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, to to me there was there was definitely learning on both sides, right? So I I think in as much as the NDM researchers sort of pushed the computer scientists to, you know, be clear about assumptions and uh and sort of be open to to ways to introduce NDM. I think the push back in the other direction was I thought was just as useful so that the NDM folks were really being pushed to articulate um, uh what they were trying to model uh in ways that could be adapted uh to computer models and uh and interfaces and that sort of thing. So, um, yeah, I think to me at least as a as a somewhat uh involved uh observer, uh just seeing that back and forth I think was incredibly useful.

**Speaker 3:** Larry, I wanted to ask, you mentioned that um, it's been a real advantage as a researcher to also have this shared experience with um other folks in the military. Um, but I'm wondering has have there has there been a a place on that government side where you've really struggled to get traction in promoting the NDM perspective? Is is there is there any um, piece there that you you you wish you'd been able to carry it forward and you just weren't.

**Speaker 4:** So, let me talk about what I would consider uh non-material solutions. So in the world that I live in now in the world of human systems integration, we talk about material and non-material solutions. So in a non-material sense, I I think NDM has made a huge impact. So I I remember distinctly looking at some of the the military decision making doctrine back in the uh, you know, early mid 90s and then watching how that morphed uh in the early to mid 2000s where the new policy now was all of a sudden talking about things like naturalistic decision making and recognition prime decision making and even intuitive thinking. Uh, who would have thought that the army that was always advocating, okay, you have to develop three courses of action, you have to war game them, you have to do look at the pros and cons and the strengths and weaknesses and then you, you know, you war game those things out, you present those results to the commander, the commander gets to decide and all of a sudden, uh, we have this new tactical decision making method that was really based and grounded in in NDM. So, I was really excited and pleased to see that. On the material solution side, I think it's way more challenging or it has been challenging to get uh NDM and cognitive engineering and even human factors things into uh, into acquisition programs. there seems to be this huge divide between uh R&D and and acquisition. And uh I had an opportunity over a few years as actually part of the ADA uh technology consortium to work with Kevin Bennett from Wright State. And Kevin and uh a couple of his students who actually became uh uh instructors for me at West Point. Uh we worked on something we called Raptor, which is an interesting acronym and I never remember it, so I actually wrote it down on what it was. So, representation aiding portrayal of tactical operations resources. representation aiding portrayal of tactical operation resource. And it was a really, really good, um, design that we came up with. So what we wanted to do is to take a a military command and control display with all of the battlefield graphics on it and and all the the information about personnel strength and equipment strength and uh things like fuel and ammunition, um, uh levels and things like that. And we wanted to automate the plan that was about to unfold. So, you're getting ready to start a mission, you can plan that mission or put that mission into the graphics on a computer, but what we weren't able to do was to provide information to the user as to or the decision maker as to when the decision maker needed to figure out how to deviate from that plan. So, plans, as everyone knows, never go as planned. There's always something that's going to happen. It doesn't survive first contact and all of that. And so, this this device, this display that we created would continually update and we simulated the continual update of it and we were able to display uh graphically the difference between what was planned and what is. And uh so the delta between what was planned and what is was presented to the user of that system in a way that made it clear how much the deviation was uh increasing or decreasing. And so that deviation was the thing that we thought he needed to know in order to make a decision as to whether he needed to change the plan, commit the reserve, withdraw, whatever it might be. Uh but uh without that kind of a of a representation, the commander was just guessing. So, we were never able to take that design and put it into uh a program somewhere. even though the army was undergoing uh uh a transition to something they called uh Cpop, Command Post of the future. And we thought that would be a perfect way to represent the information to the commander, and we just couldn't ever make it over that divide between the R&D world and the acquisition world. One of the cool things about human systems integration though, is that it's embedded in the acquisition world. And so, had I known about HSI way back then, I could have perhaps made it uh made the transition maybe a little bit easier.

**Speaker 3:** So, this is a great observation. I I mean, to your first point, I remember when, um, these terms started showing up in the military doctrine and how exciting that was. I think, um, I think folks, we didn't really dream that that was going to happen as much as we wanted it to. So that that was amazing. Um, and by the same token, your story about this really powerful, um, tool and design concept, um, that just never made it into practice, I think, um, I think we all have, have stories like that too. Um, that that is a a frustrating part of this work. Um, and it's not, it's not just the military. I I do a lot of work with the Veterans Health Administration and they have a research arm and an operations arm and we'll do, you know, really powerful research about design of health systems and, uh, somehow it's really hard to get that integrated on the operation side. So, I think that's a challenge in a lot of spaces.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, and I think that's why what I'm doing now in terms of human systems integration here at the Naval Post Graduate School is really exciting and it's an opportunity for the R&D world to figure out a way to get things into the acquisition world.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, and I think we are seeing a lot, uh, more, a big push in that direction. Different kinds of contracting vehicles. Um, the army is is is trying to reach out to, um, different kinds of companies, folks that that are less researchy and more applied. Um, so we definitely see that that there's movement in that direction.

**Speaker 4:** Back in January, the Department of Defense decided it was going to I would say revolutionize its acquisition process. So, if anyone's familiar with the acquisition process, there was this big, huge, we call it a horse blanket chart that lists all sorts of activities that take years and years and years to complete. So, in January of this year, they introduced something they call the Adaptive Acquisition Framework, AAF. And rather than there being one massive way to get through the acquisition process, there are now six different ways. So the first way is for what they're calling urgent capabilities. They need something right away. Right away meaning within the DOD less than two years, it has to go from idea to fielding. And the second way is something they call the middle tier where it is, um, based on both rapid, uh prototyping and rapid fielding. And that's I think within five years. And then there's the traditional system that they use for long uh large programs that are going to take 10 or 15 years. And then they have a software development pathway and another pathway for developing business systems and another pathway for doing services. And what I actually what we did a week ago uh today was I brought about 60 or 70 HSI practitioners from all over the federal government onto a Zoom session and I divided them up into six different groups and each of those groups worked on a pathway trying to figure out what HSI activities need to happen along each of those pathways in order for the human operator maintainer supporter to be uh foremost in in each of those acquisition and design processes. And the thing that's critical about every single one of those is at the very beginning, there are people that are writing requirements that are going to tell the contractors, the defense industry folks, whoever's designing, coding, building the system, what that system has to do. And that really is the leverage point for anything that's R&D to get into the acquisition process. If it's not in the requirements, it's not going to make it into the system. So, anything that uh that an HSI practitioner or that a uh a cognitive engineer or uh any researcher can do that wants to transition their stuff is get a hold of the requirements writers and get them to put that into uh the requirements so that the contractor then has to meet that requirement.

**Speaker 2:** Nice. So, so it sounds like they're, you know, this may be a way that things start to shift and we see, um, these these leading edge research things really start to make their way into the operations. That's exciting.

**Speaker 4:** Yep, absolutely.

**Speaker 2:** So, Larry, as as you sort of uh try to teach, uh, but also in these kinds of contexts where you're sort of trying to make the case, uh, how do you explain the relationship between NDM and HSI or NDM and acquisitions or NDM and and development? What what sort of tenants do you put forward?

**Speaker 4:** You know, I spend most of my time teaching uh HSI stuff because it's so broad uh and certainly uh NDM is a part of that but uh if your audience isn't familiar with human systems integration, um, it actually is an overarching sort of uh discipline that includes, um, seven different domains. So, it's manpower, which is the number of people that are needed to operate the system. It's personnel, which is the personnel characteristics of the people that are going to operate that system. How tall do they need to be? What what uh kind of cognitive abilities do they need? What kind of range of motion do they need? Um, and and what kind of skills do they need to have? knowledge skills and abilities. And then there's the training component. So, given the number of people you have and their their skill levels and their other attributes, how do we train them? What training do they need? Uh and then so manpower personnel training, the fourth domain would be what we call human factors engineering and that's the interface between the humans and and the technology. Be that individual or or team oriented kinds of interactions. And then habitability because particularly in the Navy, people live in their on on their uh systems, whether that's a a a uh a destroyer or a, um, a submarine or an aircraft carrier or in the army, a a tank or in the aviation, you know, community, they're helicopters or they're jets. Uh, and then we also have to take a look at safety and occupational health and then another one uh is called um, survivability and force protection. So, all those domains have to work together within the acquisition process. Uh and so we have to be able to speak the language of systems engineers, of the test and evaluation community, of the logisticians that are involved and we have to be able to kind of be the the glue that sort of holds that all together. And and part of that is uh is the NDM uh domain and make sure that as we're developing those systems, that we're not just looking at, okay, how do they make decisions, but who are those people? What kind of decisions are they making? What kind of training do they have? Uh, and uh, what's the environment? What's the context? Are they going to be doing it? Are they going to be doing it, uh, when they may be hypoxic, are they going to be doing it when they're what I call cold, tired, hungry, scared, wet? Uh and then how does that, how does that impact that and how do we need to aid them or compensate for the fact that they're doing it under these degraded conditions when they're exhausted or they're cold or whatever it might be.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, that that the whole context piece around the the findings that NDM researchers might come up with, I think is super important because I do feel there's a tendency to to focus somewhat narrowly on on decisions and expertise and uh and real world events. Um, and sometimes we sort of forget that uh both in terms of the findings we're putting forward, but also the findings we're gathering that those are in a much larger context and it sounds like HSI is really uh the sort of place where your students are learning about what that larger context is.

**Speaker 4:** Right, and obviously I'm embedded in the military domain, but the same thing holds true whether you're doing it in an operating room or in a nuclear power plant or something like that. How long has that person been on shift? If I'm going to go in for surgery, I'm going to ask, okay, when was the last time you slept? And how many times have you done this procedure? And all those things that would, uh, impact their their ability to make good decisions are sometimes beyond what typical NDM NDM researchers would would focus on, but I think it's absolutely important for them to be successful in whatever that context is.

**Speaker 2:** Right. I also wanted as you were talking about the, um, acquisition, uh, program that that you're sort of involved in this near-term or or considering near-term needs, sort of mid-term and long-term. Um, I I think NDM, uh, researchers, uh, often sort of look for a a very, I don't know how to say it, luxurious way to do research in the sense that, uh, you know, we've traditionally thought about interviews need to take two hours, we're going to need, you know, eight to 12 people to talk to and, uh, and then it's going to take us a while to work through the findings and come up with insights. So, there there is, uh, at least traditionally, um, has been a a bit of a challenge with this sort of, uh, the timeline, if you will, uh expediency of of NDM findings. And I'm wondering, um, are you seeing any opportunities to sort of, uh, be because of necessity, sort of, uh, make the whole NDM, uh, approach a bit more efficient because there is maybe an opportunity to get involved in sort of short-term, uh, you know, research opportunities and and to deliver things more rapidly. Are you seeing that as a as a challenge to the Indian community or are you seeing as as an opportunity for us to just get more efficient so that the findings can become useful?

**Speaker 4:** So I think we underestimate how much we know. Uh and I I think that, you know, we've got decades and decades of experiencing of experience in NDM and cognitive engineering and and human factors and anybody that's, you know, had a decent amount of education and a decent amount of experience in the field can probably answer a good portion of the questions that are going to be asked early in the process. And so, in the acquisition process, and I hate to keep going back to that, but that's kind of the world I'm living right now. At the very beginning of the acquisition process, they're trying to decide in the military context, okay, I want to I need a long-range reconnaissance capability. And that's the need for a four-star admiral or general that's a combatant commander in some region of the world. They need a long-range reconnaissance capability. How do I do that? Well, I could do that with uh a satellite-based system. I could do it with a a manned uh aerial system. I could do it with an unmanned aerial system. I can use, um, sensors that are dropped uh on the ground somewhere. I could even do it with humans. If I put humans out there in different places around the world, around the globe. At that point in time, we're so very early on in the acquisition process, the cost estimators and engineers are are giving people these wild estimates. How much is that system going to cost? Well, you ask a cost estimator, they'll tell you somewhere between two billion and 20 billion uh dollars. between two billion and 20 billion dollars. You ask a human factors or or NDM researcher or whoever, someone that's sort of grounded in the empirical research methods, they're going to say, well, give me six months and $500,000 and you know, this many people and I'll give you the answer to a level of significance of 0.05 or 0.01. No, they don't want that. If you ask them, if they ask you what, what you think, they're just looking for a an answer that's no more precise than what the cost estimator gave or what the engineer gave. Uh and so we have to kind of get over ourselves and our desire for precision early in the acquisition process and give them our best guess because once we tell them that it's going to take six months and $500,000, they're going to walk away and say, forget about you guys, you're no good to us. So we have to be educated enough and skilled enough and and practiced enough in our in our field to be able to give them an answer that we are, you know, 85 and 75% confident in. And then as the system matures and as those parameters have to tighten down, we can have the research uh that will give us the the more narrowly defined answer.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, that that sounds like a tremendously valuable lesson uh for for this community to realize, um, and I'm sure we, you know, we all get caught up in in that ideal project, right? We we're trying to propose what would be ideal, but but what you're suggesting is that, uh, sometimes good enough is is good enough to get us started. Um, so yeah, that that's tremendously important. I want to switch a bit to your sort of teaching role, um, and you're teaching at NPS, uh, and you've taught for many years, uh, on faculty at West Point. I'm just curious if if there's any way that you can think that your NDM perspective and and the sort of the ethos of of NDM kind of influenced the way that you went about teaching and mentoring cadets and, uh, and others who you've taught.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, I got back to West Point in 1995. Uh, so that after I finished my PhD at Ohio State, I got back there in 1995 and I I spent a year just sort of observing what was going on and and how the program was functioning. And after the end of that year, I gathered the the uh, the staff together, the research staff together. I had I had three people that were full-time research folks and then I had about four or five uh junior faculty members that taught in my program. I said, look, we're transitioning to what was being done, which is sort of all over the map, different kinds of research projects and different areas of of human factors. And I said, we are we are now moving towards a sort of a command decision. And I said, we are now moving towards uh doing research in in military Command and Control uh and in particular military decision making. So we began to reorient the uh the facilities and the research topics and the research dollars that we went after uh to focus in in that area, which is actually how I wound up working with the Fed Lab and then eventually the advanced decision architectures programs. And then obviously the cadet projects uh that cadets would do for their capstones and for their uh course projects then began to focus in those areas as well.

**Speaker 3:** So, Larry, as you think back over your career, you have this operational experience, you've had this teaching experience, you've been a researcher. It's what, what aspects of your work have been most rewarding to you?

**Speaker 4:** I would say without question, it's the mentoring that I've done with the cadets over the years. I I love teaching. In fact, when I was getting ready to retire in 2005, uh uh about a year or so before I began looking around to see, okay, what do I want to do after I take off my uniform? And I had the opportunity to work with all sorts of wonderful wonderful folks that I had been working with, uh, in the, um, the Advanced Decision Architecture architectures, uh, consortium. And I but I felt like I still had this passion to teach. And so now, 15 years later, I still love teaching and I still love mentoring students. Uh, I I just was on the phone, uh, a few days ago with a an incoming uh PhD student here at NPS. Um, his name is Charlie Rowan. Charlie was in my class in 2004, 2005 uh at West Point. He was an engineering psychology major. Uh, fast forward uh to 2012 and Charlie comes to NPS to get his Master's degree under me. Uh and then he went back to my old program at West Point to teach in it. And then now fast forward to 2020 and he's showing up here at NPS in about uh a month or so to begin working on his PhD with me. So, and and that's one story. There are there are lots of other stories about uh cadets and NPS graduates who have come back and expressed their appreciation and have gone out and done great things in the Army or the Navy, uh with respect to human factors and and HSI and uh decision making. So, that to me is tremendously rewarding.

**Speaker 3:** So, that answer does not surprise me. In part because the first time I met you, I think I was at a conference or something and you were giving a talk and I'm just sitting there passively taking notes and then you called me by name and I stood up, I don't even remember what I had to do, but it was the way you kind of engaged with the people in the audience, me in particular, and, um, and got everyone involved and and actively following along, um, just really struck me. So, I'm not surprised to hear that that's, that's really what you love to do.

**Speaker 4:** I remember that to this day. I put my hat on you. I put my military Lieutenant Colonel hat on you. I was Lieutenant Colonel at the time. And I I think I said, you are now the commander, what are you going to do? Uh or something like that. I I remember that to this day.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, and I probably looked like a deer in the headlights. I had no idea. But, um, but it was awesome. You know, I was completely in the moment. That was that was great. Yeah.

**Speaker 4:** Well, I still like to do those things when when students come in the classroom. While I will give them a scenario, I'll send them to the board. I will, um, get them to engage with material uh that really reinforces what it is that they uh read or studied the night before. Uh and I get lots of good feedback for that. And I just I love that that interaction with the with the students.

**Speaker 3:** I'm sure. Yeah, and I'm sure they really appreciate it too. Um, so, I I'm I'm gonna ask another question here. As you, as you work with students, um, and I know you've worked with, you know, young cadets and more experienced graduate students, um, but but what is, what is one of the most surprising things that that comes to you as you as as you think about your work with students? What have you learned from them, maybe?

**Speaker 4:** Well, one of the reasons I'm teaching out here at NPS is because the students out here are every bit as impressive as the cadets at West Point. The cadets at West Point and other service academies are just the, you know, the best of the best that the country has to offer. And the students here at NPS are the same type of people. They just happen to be about 10 years older and now they've got uh families and children and so forth. And so they're, their curiosity and their enthusiasm is is contagious. I have been teaching the last couple years, um, a group of systems engineering students all about human systems integration and uh cognitive engineering and decision making and so forth. And to see them get so excited about it, uh is just really refreshing. Not only that, but when they graduate from NPS, they go to acquisition programs to be assistant program managers or they go to the contracting offices offices that are going to engage with the industry folks to uh put the contracts out there to build the system. So, getting them excited about about the human element and then knowing that they're going to go out there and do those jobs, uh, is is exciting. You know, I I've taught now going on 28 years, counting my time at West Point and here and it's in the last two or three years that I'm teaching these folks that I think that, yeah, these people are going to go out and really make a difference because they're going to take what they learned in my class and they're going to remember it and they're going to make sure that the human is central to the design of the system.

**Speaker 2:** So, Larry, you've obviously taught and mentored hundreds if not thousands. Uh, I'm I'm wondering if you can give us sort of your top three mentors. Who do you look uh and think about as being the folks that influenced you the most?

**Speaker 4:** Well, you guys know me well enough to know that the names that I'll give you probably won't be a surprise. I would tell you that the the first one is uh is uh David Woods. So Dave was my, um, my PhD advisor at Ohio State. In fact, when I showed up though, it was supposed to be Phil Smith. And so, um, I looked before I got to Ohio State, I looked at what the various faculty members were going to be working on. I thought, okay, uh, I think what I was interested in was more aligned with what Phil Smith was working on. So I showed up and they said, oh, uh, Dr. David Woods is going to be your advisor. I said, okay, we'll see how that works out. And and sure enough, it worked out great. Um, I love his, his energy and his passion. He's got more ideas than any one man has a right to have. Uh, he's always on the leading edge of whatever's going on and, you know, it started back with CETM uh and um or cognitive systems engineering and NDM and then resilience and I just heard him uh a week or two ago doing a podcast on COVID-19. So, he's one. Second one is Gary Klein. Uh I just saw that a uh a video of him a couple days ago uh doing a talk which I think he did in 2017. It was called on anticipatory thinking, which I thought was great. And what I love about Gary is that he's got this incredible way of storytelling and I wish I were a better storyteller like him. He he typically, as you guys know, um, we'll put up a a slide and we'll, we'll list these, you know, six or seven or eight bullets on the slide and you'll look at them and and, you know, you'll say, okay, yeah, got it, got it, got it. That all makes sense. And then he'll say, well, I'm here to tell you why all of those are exactly wrong. And you're like, what? Uh, and so I love that storytelling uh nature of him. I love the fact that he's a prolific author. I love his curiosity, uh, and his very humble approach to things. Uh, third one would be uh Robert Hoffman. Um, I've got a chance to know Robert over the years, particularly through the the ADA consortium. Uh just a brilliant guy, so intelligent. Um, and I think he's a great foil to folks like like Dave Woods. Uh and I love the experimental psychologist in him where he will just grill you and grill you to make sure that your study is is tight, uh, and there are no confounds in it whatsoever. Uh, an amazing editor and writer. Um, he actually edited a a paper uh that my wife and I wrote. Uh, tore it up and I we thought, wow, we're never going to submit it because why bother? It was so badly edited or or uh and apparently poorly written, but we we we uh persevered and it actually wound up winning a best paper award in the in the uh the Journal of organizational behavior. Uh so we have Robert to thank for that. Plus, Robert always knows the best restaurants to go to. No matter where you are, he will take you to the best restaurant. So those are the top three folks for me.

**Speaker 2:** Anybody outside of NDM that uh has been a big influence?

**Speaker 4:** My wife. Um, I will tell you that I I am so amazed by her. She is uh one of the most uh kindest and and tender-hearted people uh I've ever met. But she's got this incredible uh passion for what it is that she does. If you've have not if not familiar with her work, uh she's been working on sleep and fatigue issues in the military for the last two decades and she has almost single-handedly changed the culture of the Department of the Navy so that they are now thinking rightly about sleep and fatigue and human performance. And I I am in awe of her ability to do that. The other thing I'm in awe of is her intuitive nature. So, it's it's probably my my personality but probably some of my military training where if I'm going to go from A to Z, I have to get through, you know, B to Y before I get there. Otherwise it just doesn't work for me. She can go from A to Z in a heartbeat and then when I get to Z, I typically I have to respond was with, oh, oh, now I see what you you were thinking about and what you were telling me to do. But, um, but she's incredibly uh gifted and um, I'm really proud of her and uh I love working with her. We just don't get to work together very often though.

**Speaker 3:** Okay, I I have another question I'm going to ask. Um, uh, so imagine you meet a complete stranger who claims to practice NDM. On pain of death, you are given one question to determine if they do indeed practice NDM. What do you ask?

**Speaker 4:** That's a really interesting question. I I would ask them, um, where they're doing their research. And and if they tell me they're doing it in their office or their their laboratory, I would tell them that they are not doing NDM. If they tell me they're doing it uh in in the field, in a nuclear power plant, in a uh operating room, or some place where there's actual real work going on, then the chances are they may they may be doing NDM.

**Speaker 2:** So the the context matters.

**Speaker 4:** Absolutely.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, interesting. All right, we have uh one last somewhat fun question. Um, we are going to ask you to tell us two truths about yourself and one lie and then we're both going to try to guess the lie.

**Speaker 4:** Okay. Two truths and a lie. I'll do this in chronological order. When I was at West Point, I was on the Army football team. Second, When I was at the Army War College, I went out and played golf and shot a hole in one. And third, about 18 months ago, I became a grandfather for the first time.

**Speaker 2:** Hmm. Two sports and a family. Let's see. I am not sure you were on the football team. I'm going to say that's the lie.

**Speaker 3:** I think hardly anyone gets a hole in one. I'm going to say that's the lie.

**Speaker 4:** Okay. I was not on the football team, but I was on the cadet gymnastics team for four years. And I was the tallest I was the tallest gymnast on the team. Um, I did actually get a hole in one on a par three, 186 yard at the Army War College golf course. And I was I had played golf like three or four times in my life and the uh, so one of the people I was playing with, who was a scratch golfer, uh she handed me her club and said, here, use this and I hit it in the hole and I was as shocked as anybody. And uh I am in fact a grandfather of an 18-month old uh James Kelly.

**Speaker 2:** Wow.

**Speaker 3:** Congratulations.

**Speaker 4:** Thank you.

**Speaker 2:** And that sounds like the perfect place to wrap up the conversation. Um, thank you so much Larry. This has been awesome speaking with you and uh I I I think the lessons that you're uh offering on the chat with us today, but also clearly to generations of students about how to put NDM in context are incredibly important. So it's been a pleasure to speak with you about them.

**Speaker 4:** My pleasure too. Thanks so much for the opportunity.

**Speaker 2:** And with that, uh we will close out for the NDM podcast. I'm Brian Moon.

**Speaker 3:** And I'm Laura Milatella. Learn more about naturalistic decision making and where to follow us by visiting naturalisticdecisionmaking.org.
