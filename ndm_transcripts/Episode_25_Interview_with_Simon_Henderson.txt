**Speaker 1:** The Naturalistic Decision Making podcast with Brian Moon and Laura Millatello. This podcast series brings you interviews with leading NDM researchers who study and support people who make decisions under stress.

**Speaker 1:** Welcome to the Naturalistic Decision Making podcast. This is Brian Moon from Parallaxian Technologies.

**Speaker 2:** And I'm Laura Millatello from Applied Decision Science.

**Speaker 1:** We're very happy today to talk to Simon Henderson. Simon is an independent deception consultant working in the UK and the US. His career has involved researching, teaching, and consulting on deception, counter-deception, information operations and cyber operations within a variety of government, military and law enforcement organizations. He's passionate about novel and pro-social applications in these fields. Simon received a higher national diploma in Computer Science from Portsmouth Polytechnic in 1987. He covers his work on his blog deceptionbydesign.com, which is also the title of a book he's currently writing. Welcome Simon, thank you for joining us.

**Speaker 3:** Yes, a pleasure to be here and nice to uh catch up with you guys again.

**Speaker 1:** Great, so let's uh I think we want the our listeners to get a bit of background on you. Um in particular, can you sort of walk us through your pathway of of coming to a career in deception?

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, I I've always described my career as as really being in in two halves. The the first half of my career was really spent uh looking to improve sense making, decision making and collective performance and the second half of my career was spent trying to make those things worse. Um, largely in uh adversary teams uh in counterterrorism, uh law enforcement, uh so trying to disrupt uh criminal organizations, sense making, decision making, uh etc. So, um, it really began being 1987 I joined uh the Ministry of Defense at Fort Halstead in Sevenoaks. I was employed as a scientific officer and uh really as a computer scientist, I spent uh a couple of years uh developing simulations to evaluate the impacts of uh planning and decision support systems on military command and control. So I was using system dynamics, a blend of sort of softer systems but also some quite hard uh simulation and uh optimization approaches. Um, but after a couple of years doing that I transferred to a group that was literally across the road. And uh it was doing experimental and field evaluations of command planning tools. So, essentially seeking to understand command planning uh without support tools and then to measure and evaluate the impact that support tools would have on those processes. Uh, and it was in this group that I uh met uh and started working with my my good friend and and colleague uh Rath Pascal and it led to about you know, in the order of 15 years uh work studying sense making, decision making and and collective performance in military planning and intelligence teams. Um, the part of the MOD I was in uh was privatized in 2001 uh and turned into a commercial company called Kinetic. Uh, and for the first couple of years in Kinetic that was around, um, they I said the the the early 2000s, but there was a push to try and expand uh into non-defense and security areas. So, uh, I was involved in studying decision making in uh surgical teams, uh oil exploration and uh facility management teams, European Space Agency, police firearms teams, crisis management teams. Uh, I was supporting a team that was racing to the South Pole. So it had expanded very broadly into uh other areas. Um, but then the work sort of came back very much to a defense and security focus. And uh, around that time, I put in a proposal to look at what the military could learn about deception in other domains. I've I've had a passion and an interest in magic and conjuring since my my childhood and I thought it would be interesting to look at principles that could be drawn from that field and others to support military planners when they're they're trying to work out how to go about deceiving an enemy force. And that work was funded and it led to the second half of my career which was about another 15 years of almost continuously funded work studying deception and influence uh in the real world and uh increasingly in cyber space as well. So, uh, it was a interesting process to go from trying to make those processes better to looking at how they go wrong and potentially uh in certain circumstances can be led to go wrong.

**Speaker 1:** Right. Yeah, that uh it's quite a turn. Um. So, so back to sort of those uh issues around sense making and and planning and and you mentioned your your colleague. Was that sort of your first exposure to NDM or how did you how did you first become aware of NDM?

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, well, um, initially as I mentioned, we were trying to evaluate the impact of of support tools on um decision making and and broader collective planning processes. And it was very clear that we actually needed to understand the the the non-supported, the the manual processes in a lot more detail to be able to to really, um, say anything useful about how these tools were were having an impact. And increasingly we started studying those processes more and more and actually had quite a long time where we weren't looking at technology at all. And you around the early 90s, we were trying to explain what we were seeing and what people were were telling us about their decision making processes using the models we we had available. Um which were largely sort of classical analytical models. And at the surface level it made sense to to to use some of those approaches for for understanding what we were seeing because military doctrine was describing decision making in those terms. generating multiple courses of action, having a predefined set of criteria against which to evaluate those courses, um applying each course of action against these criteria, evaluating it on a scale of 1 to 10, putting in weightings, adding up numbers and and picking the course of action that had the highest score. Um, so it it's there's some sort of correspondence, but at the same time, that wasn't what we were seeing. That wasn't what people were were telling us. And it was a colleague of ours, George Brander who was working at the uh sort of naval uh military research site down in Portsmouth who first mentioned and passed us, I think it was a couple of papers from Gary Klein on um recognition primed decision making and just straight away these light bulbs went off. Um, these approaches corresponded with what people were telling us and what we were seeing, uh, and very quickly we decided we needed to understand these approaches better and put in a proposal to essentially do a review of the the the science and practice of of decision making and supporting decision making. Um, and uh, essentially a a literature review plus a lot of other analytical work on the the back of that to try and understand what theory said about decision making. And that work, uh we invited uh Gary over to review it. Uh so again, this was early early 90s and um Gary provided a a peer review for that. I I remember we were quite apprehensive about him coming and and looking at what we were doing. Uh the day before he arrived to to talk to us and and go through our our work. Um we ended up working through the night. We were developing we we initially was were struggling with some of the the different terminology that seemed to be used to describe similar things. So, models that would talk about um mental models or frames or scripts or schema. Um, and so we we started trying to draw out this this huge matrix of the terminology that was relating to these different components of decision making and it it just expanded out into this huge task that took us ages. Uh, and so we we somehow ended up working through the night before Gary arrived. Uh I managed to to go home and at least have a a shower before I came back into to work and he arrived. Um, but the very first thing Gary said to us um having looked at our work was what this huge matrix was about, um, and who it was for. And it was a question we'd never really considered. And um, as he probed us about how somebody would would use it, it was very clear that this um thing that had taken us ages was really of very little use and we ended up leaving it out of the report. Um, but uh, yeah, that was after that was sort of the route into to NDM and we very quickly uh established a relationship with Gary and he invited us over to um talk about some of our our work at I think the second uh NDM conference in Dayton. So, uh, yeah, that was sort of how we got into NDM initially.

**Speaker 1:** So you got in and and you realized that these terms were sort of all over the map, it sounds like.

**Speaker 3:** Yes, yeah, it it was an impossible task to try and resolve them all. Uh and so this this huge, great big complex, um, thing that we spent way way too long on, um was of very little use in the end and that's why we decided to leave it out.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, the the terminology, especially in those days, I imagine, uh is these models were were first taking shape and and discussions were ongoing. I imagine that was a a very confusing time.

**Speaker 3:** It it it was, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker 1:** But but so just to walk back a little bit. So, so it sounds like you're a you're a young uh computer scientist, uh who's now out watching people perform in the real world, going in with this idea in your head that uh that they're going to be corresponding to doctrine. Uh, that wasn't sitting well with you though, it sounds like as you were as you were seeing what they were actually doing. And so you get these descriptions of of real world decision making, uh it that felt like a good match to you.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, very very much so. Um, it it just intuitively made sense and when we were asking people about their decision making, they were talking about just knowing what to do. Um, when we were asking them whether they were, you know, how they were were making decisions, I mean it very much corresponded with with what Gary was talking about with the fire commanders that people were just using intuition and their experience to uh know the kinds of things that they should be doing under under certain circumstances and adapting what they had done previously to to fit the problem at hand. We following the the the back of this initial survey of the theory of decision making, the we put in another proposal that was um accepted to do some uh experimental work where we um ran a series of exercises with uh 16 military uh command planners and subjected them to a range of different scenarios um where they were having to make quite complex decisions and we videotaped the processes. We gave them a very rich, um sort of high fidelity simulation environment where we had um simulation of all of the facilities and information flows and resources that they would have uh in headquarters. So it it was in a laboratory but it was a a room with lots of facilities which corresponds exactly with the environment that they would be doing this in for real. Um, but uh it was video recorded and we also uh by then had done a critical decision method course with Gary. I think it was the first course he had run in the UK. So we were using uh critical decision method interviews to um elicit a deeper understanding together with video playback and we were using uh speak aloud protocols as well that we had spent quite a lot of time developing to really get into the detail of understanding how people were were making decisions and we spent weeks and weeks, um, transcribing and codifying what they were telling us in order to look at which of these models that were available to us best best helped to explain what we were were seeing and we found studying, I think it was somewhere around 600 individual decisions we had identified across these scenarios that uh 87% of the decisions were best explained using recognition primed decision making. And that gave us a a lot of confidence in um really adopting these these methods as a as a primary set of tools for understanding and explaining and also then ultimately looking at supporting and enhancing these these processes. Um, we had a uh a chapter in the I think it was the the second NDM uh conference book. Uh, and that seemed to get picked up and was quite widely referenced uh in sort of military command thinking in in the UK. There was an article that was published in the British Army review uh about a year or so later written by a Brigadier. Um, and I our study had found that about 2% of the decisions we were were were studying had had been made using these these more traditional methods where people were comparing options and and using some sort of criteria for evaluating options, but they tended to be things that involved quite quantitative information. looking at time and space and movements and logistics and and things like that. Um, so around two two percent and the this article appeared in British Army review that was titled, why do we teach a planning process that only 2% of our staff use? Uh, and it was using our our work as a primary source. And that isn't what we had said at all. There was nothing about 2% of planners using it, it was about 2% of the decisions we had studied. So the the sort of premise of the article was slightly, slightly warped from from what we had found. But nonetheless, that article served as a as a really good catalyst for increasing, um, a sort of awareness and interest in intuitive decision making and, uh, it was very gratifying to see certainly within the UK that, uh, recognition of intuitive decision making, um, got formal recognition, uh, was put into, uh, certainly army, uh, at the time army doctrine, uh, and that it was recognized as as a valid approach, together with with more analytical approaches under certain conditions, but, uh, very gratifying to to to see that work leading to having an impact on on doctrine.

**Speaker 1:** Right. Yeah, I remember Gary sort of having similar feelings when the Recognition and Planning model started getting uh that that kind of attention as well. Yeah. I'm wondering though, um, so the recognition's great, uh and and the gratification's great. What what kind of pushback though was there? Surely some folks were were not keen to uh to change the tradition.

**Speaker 3:** Um, from from the uh, the the actual doers, the the the the people that were doing the the the planning, I had to say we had no pushback at all, quite quite the opposite. Um, it it just all made sense and was it corresponded with what they did. And I think um that official recognition that there was validity in in those approaches and recognition of those approaches was was um a relief or or certainly um uh provided some sort of top cover for for intuition um being a an appropriate way for experienced uh planners to to do their decision making. Um, there was of course you know, issues concerning validity and reliability and um, you know, when is it appropriate to use more more formal structured approaches? Is there a danger of of missing uh, you know, unseen opportunities by just using intuition. Um, you know, doctrine still talked about comparing multiple courses of action. Um, and of course the the whole issue about is that really an effective way of of using precious time uh particularly when you're under under pressure to to plan things quite rapidly and there's a lot of complexity, you know, trying to quantify these very um broad plans and and and applying numbers to them. Uh you know, doctrine dictates that some commanders would want to see these multiple courses being presented. And and yeah, there are some benefits in in doing that if if you can, but you know, these sorts of issues were were um certainly being being discussed. I think the only only pushback really came from, um, some of the sort of harder modelers and um, operational research. Uh, people that were were very much into trying to quantify and, you know, as as I started myself, you know, developing simulations and um, numerical models of some of these processes for looking at trying to represent and and and simulate these things, you know, intuitive decision making doesn't lend itself necessarily, um, immediately to to simulation. So, I I that was really the only point of friction I I I would say.

**Speaker 2:** Interesting. So, hey Simon, I wanted to ask you about this turning point in your career you described where, um, you wrote a proposal about what the military could learn from the magic, conjuring and deception community. So this link very obvious to you, but I'm wondering if you would just tell us more about kind of the insights that that drove that uh emphasis and how you convinced people that this was a great direction to go in?

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, um, well, I I I have an interest in magic and conjuring that goes back to my childhood. Uh, and I just part of me wondered whether I could get the the MOD Ministry of Defense to to pay for some magic books. But I, um, I started looking into military uh deception and it seemed to be an area where there wasn't a great deal of attention or focus, very, very little in the way of research that existed within the UK. And I was very interested in in deception in other domains as as well. The scams and confidence tricks and animal deception, political deception, um, many, many different areas where where, you know, deception occurs. And so, um, it sounds sounds highly unlikely but I I promise this is true. I I wrote a proposal suggesting that, uh, we do a review of deception in other domains and see if we could synthesize a set of principles that could inform military deception planning. And that initial proposal was rejected on the basis of not being innovative enough, which I I was quite surprised by. And, uh, again, it was, uh, my colleague George Brander who suggested just changing the title and resubmitting it, um, just to see what would happen. In, uh, and I I swear to you that is is what I did. I I changed the title and I resubmitted it and it was accepted and there were comments about how how innovative it was. And I can only presume that the people that were assessing or reviewing the proposal had had changed because it was the the the same proposal. Uh, and and so it was such a an appropriate way to to start off the the study of deception. Um, but yeah, there there were certain individuals, um, primarily in the the, uh, military intelligence areas. It was funded through a an intelligence funding route. And despite the fact that it was primarily looking at what planners could could draw from other domains, and that, um, initial work, which reviewed deception in many different areas, including political deception and, uh, advertising and marketing, as well as the other areas I had mentioned. Um, pulled out a set of generic principles, uh, about how, um, there may be generic processes that could be, uh, transported from other areas and, uh, employed to support the creative thinking about how to to fool adversaries. That work seemed to go down very, very well. I, uh, was asked to then support a range of, um, other studies. Uh, there were some specific questions I I was asked to to look at exploring, um, and put in some additional proposals, and it it just expanded and, um, ran for, well, 15, another 15 years of working across a wide, wide range of of different areas, um, where deception is employed and and a a range of different studies looking at, uh, really getting a a better handle on the the psychological basis on on which people, um, are fooled.

**Speaker 2:** So, can you give us an example of one of these generic processes?

**Speaker 3:** Okay, um, so something like misdirection. Uh, misdirection is a a slightly woolly term, is is widely used in in magic and, um, generally it's recognized as getting people to look away from where some secret move takes place. Um, but in reality, misdirection is about controlling a a target's attention, leading them to to look in, uh, a place that is different from where some secret action is occurring. Um, and there are lots of other types of of misdirection as well. So it's not just affecting where somebody looks, but it's affecting when they look, affecting how they look. Um, and there are ways of of misdirecting how people remember and recall something, there are linguistic, um, forms of misdirection to change emphasis of of how people are processing information. but typically misdirection tends to be used in terms of affecting where somebody is looking. Uh, and there are sort of two primary ways to to to do that, um, which correspond with with theories of bottom up and and top down attention. Um, you can, um, seek to seduce their attention and attract their attention through, uh, conspicuousity. So things like movement, contrast, um, your absence under some conditions, size, repetition, very various things are that are highly conspicuous will lead somebody to to tend to to look at those things in an environment. And from the top down perspective, if you can create certain expectations in somebody's head, for example, through repetition or conditioning or by portraying causality, um, leading them to project forward into the the future, then people will direct their attention to where they're expecting something interesting to occur. And there are other things as well, saliency, you know, people will pay more attention to things in the environment that correspond with things that are at the forefront of of their mind that they're currently thinking about. If if one of those things is present, you'll you're probably going to look at it. Um, so magicians use use this all the time, they use movement, um, and, uh, conspicuousity to attract attention. If you're palming a coin, for example, you might, um, stare at the hand that is pretending to hold the coin as it moves away. Um, so you're using, uh, sort of social, um, effects to lead your audience to also look at that empty hand. Um, but, you know, so misdirection is is used a lot in in magic, but it's also used in pretty much every other domain where, um, where, uh, deception occurs. So, the military will use diversions, will create a lot of noise, um, in one particular area of the battlefield to seduce the enemy's attention to that area whilst they can move in a different location with less attention being paid to them. Um, you know, politicians use misdirection by, for example, releasing news stories that attract a lot of attention, um, to take attention away from something they don't want, um, you know, the press, for example, to be paying too much attention to, so using highly conspicuous stories to try and shape and control attention. Um, animals use misdirection to, um, seduce predators, uh, attention in certain ways. So, for example, uh, plovers, uh, killdeers, um, have ground nests which when they have chicks in, if if a fox starts approaching the the nest, the adult bird will simulate having a broken wing. Um, some species actually have red patches under their their wing to to which sort of simulate blood, but they'll show signs of distress and, um, start struggling on the ground to lure a fox away from the nest and will keep hopping just out of reach of the the fox and lead it away from from the nest. But again, it's it's you get these generic principles of using conspicuousity, uh, and creating expectations to to affect, um, your opponent's attention. And you see that being used pretty much everywhere where where deception occurs. So that's sort of a generic generic approach. And there are many, many other generic, um, strategies that are employed once you start looking at deception across a variety of of different domains. And it's this sort of commonality, uh, in these strategies that has really been driving a lot of my thinking around deception, trying to collect these patterns, these recurring strategies that you you see being used in very different and and diverse domains. That has really been a route into getting a much better understanding of deception as a generic set of phenomena.

**Speaker 2:** So, because this is something that you study, do you see it everywhere?

**Speaker 3:** Uh, yes, yeah, absolutely everywhere. Um, I started started writing a a paper called, um, yeah, I I can't remember exactly what what the title was. 10 10 cases of deception before breakfast. Uh, the the idea being that from the moment you you wake up, you're you're exposed to deception. You're absolutely everywhere. Whether that's uh having set your alarm clock to wake you up 10 minutes before the time you actually need to wake up, uh you get up, you go into the bathroom and suddenly you're surrounded by by products. Yeah, your your toothpaste has foaming agent in it that fulfills absolutely no function whatsoever other than giving you a mouth feel to suggest that there's some sort of process taking place in your mouth. There's absolutely no need for your toothpaste to to foam up whatsoever. Um, you know, the scented shower products that you use, the fact you're putting on deodorant to mask body odor, uh, and, you know, uh, block the perception of of, um, you know, sense that are already there. Um, you turn on the radio and there are adverts, the packaging of your breakfast products. You you just from the moment you open your your eyes, you're being exposed to deception. And once you start recognizing deception, you just, yeah, I I guess it's the the anybody working in any certain profession, you you become a lot more attuned to to spotting and noticing it everywhere. But it it is everywhere around us and we're exposed all the time to things that are deceptive and manipulative, um, without having any real awareness because we're so so used to seeing these things.

**Speaker 1:** Right. Well, that's some really ruining my entire day, so thank you.

**Speaker 3:** Hmm.

**Speaker 1:** Um, so there's a there's a question sort of crystalizing in my head and I think I need to sort of talk through it, uh, to lay it out. But so so what you just talked about, all the strategies, um, are geared toward, uh, deceiving, let's just say the the common pedestrian if you will. But if we go back to the RPD model, uh, I mean sort of stage one is finding those, you know, those important cues that tell you more precisely sort of what's going on in a given situation. So I'm wondering, how does deception against experts look? Or or or what are you trying to get at there? Because if the if the idea is, you know, the those sort of common elements of deception might work against novices, if you will, or the the sort of common pedestrian, um, what what sort of things are you thinking about as you're trying to deceive other experts?

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, it's a it's a a very uh, good point you you raise there, um, because in in many domains where deception occurs, there is asymmetry in the level of expertise. So in in magic, magic relies on the fact that your audience does not understand the principles of of magic. Um, and and that asymmetry in expertise is really what enables a lot of magic to to work. In other domains like military deception, you're up against an adversary that is very familiar with with the military. So, um, they may not be that familiar with deception necessarily, but they understand the uh environment within which deception is taking place and therefore are far better uh able to recognize when uh, things are are different from what they would expect to be seeing. So, uh, deceiving experts in some senses is harder because they have more understanding about norms and prototycality uh and can spot deviations and anomalies that may be may be present. But at the same time, expertise and reliance upon recognition uh and upon the whole area of of pattern matching and pattern recognition, um makes people potentially more vulnerable to to being deceived. And uh there was uh a great Barton Waley, uh, one of the sort of um, probably greatest uh, um, yeah, experts on on deception put together a uh a taxonomy that describes a set of strategies for both uh hiding things that are real and showing things that are are false. And essentially it's all about manipulating the cues and indicators that together present the patterns that create meaning that uh supports essentially recognition and uh RPD. Um, so understanding the the the patterns that experts use to make sense of the world is fundamental to looking at strategies for presenting what appear on the the the face of it to be patterns of normality that can conform to to experts' expectations about uh, what they would expect to see in the environment. Um, so, you know, strategies identified by Waidi include something like repackaging as a way of hiding something that is real. You take um an object or a process, uh, and you add other cues and indicators around it to essentially create a wrapper around that object or process and it's the the wrapper that's being perceived and used to support, um, you know, pattern matching, um, and the the underlying objects or actions are are are not seen. Uh, an example a very simple example of that would be in the Second World War. There was a a device produced called a a sun shield which was essentially a canvas and and wooden structure that would be wrapped around a a tank in order to make it look like a a 10-ton truck. Uh and it's a great example of repackaging. It it's literally putting the packaging of a tank on the outside, sorry, of a of a truck on the outside of a of a tank. Um, but that scales up to larger processes, you know, movements, uh, and actions can also be be repackaged and there are a variety of of other, um, strategies as well. But but essentially falling experts is about giving them what they expect to see in terms of creating the the patterns, um, that are used for for sense making.

**Speaker 1:** Are there also attempts to get into the, um, other sort of cycles within RPD, so to get in, you know, the mental simulation cycle and did it does it go that far or is it?

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, yes, yeah, very very much so. I mean, what one of the fundamental tenants of a lot of deception is that you you never want to give, uh, your target the entire solution, uh, on on a plate. You want to make them work to have to derive meaning, uh, and construct their understanding of the you want them to invest effort in building themselves, their own understanding, uh, of what they they think is happening. So, splitting the the the cues up, putting cues, um, in, you know, fragmenting the the pattern very deliberately across time and space, so that they they have to work to go off and search and discover parts of the the, you know, the cue sequences that form these patterns, uh, is a a fundamental, uh, principle. Um, you could also create patterns with gaps that, uh, prompt people into into searching for additional information, uh, that, um, you can combine with with planting, so putting information where you know people are going to search to to formulate the pattern. And yeah, I find myself drawing very significantly from the data frame model as a basis for for understanding patterns, uh, and the the the pattern recognition process, the the loops within the data frame model, so reframing, uh, elaboration cycles and preservation cycles, uh, are really useful ways to to to think about, um, the process of of sense making for deception. You know, you want to prompt erroneous recognition. Um, you want to prompt abandonment of of correct sense making, get people to reframe onto erroneous sense making, um, cast doubt on on correct sense making and and preserve the the erroneous sense making that they're they're forming particularly in light of contradictory evidence. Um, so finding ways to try and explain away all all all the, um, uh, things to do with effective decision making and not explaining away anomalies, uh, with deception, you want to prompt explaining away of of anomalies that may indicate, um, the reality of of what is happening.

**Speaker 1:** This is a bit of a side note, my family and I've been, uh, since the holidays playing these murder mystery games now that you can buy and they'll give you a whole, you know, unsolved crime. Uh, and everything you're saying I can now think back to to exactly seeing that, uh, people get through these but, um, yeah, it's very clever what they're doing, but, um, it's also interesting just to sort of watch different sort of members of the family go after different things. And so, some will jump right into the, you know, the uh, interrogation interviews, uh, some of us, some of us, some of us will uh, look at more of the sort of hard evidence that's being presented in terms of the picture showing you and so, uh, yeah, there's now a whole cottage industry, yeah, that's taking advantage of this.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, yeah. Um, I mean there are there are a whole whole series of these uh, games that uh, that seem to be uh, becoming popular at the moment. And uh, I I think they're very interesting in in in terms of deception. And I think there's a lot of opportunity for, um, generating games that are a lot richer by by bringing in an understanding of of deception and deceptive uh strategies. So, and and there have been some very interesting um computer games uh that have been developed. Uh there are a few military uh strategy games that were based around uh deception. So, uh, yeah, it can be very, very entertaining uh amongst friends. Um, things that, uh, games that do involve, um, deception or or or lying can be very entertaining.

**Speaker 2:** This is kind of a fun question. Uh, so, uh, imagine that you meet a complete stranger who claims to practice magic. On pain of death, you're given one question to determine if they do indeed practice magic. What would you ask?

**Speaker 3:** It's uh, tricky, tricky question. I I I think the term practice I I'm presuming here that we're we're not talking about practice in terms of people sitting in their bedroom practicing magic. Um, but uh, it's also interesting because I I think there's a difference between people that perform magic, um, you know, that in big, very big quotations, that do tricks versus people that design magic and design, um, illusions and, uh, sort of methods for for for folding people. Those can be very different. Uh, and, you know, similarly though those people you may be an expert in performance, you may be an expert in design, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're an expert in in teaching, um, magic or or in applying the principles of magic elsewhere. So it's it's difficult to, um, sort of come up with a single question that that addresses all these different angles. But I I think for me an interesting question would be to understand where people have struggled with magic, either with its performance or or with with magic theory. Understanding where they have found approaches to be difficult to implement and and why. Really trying to get at their their experience of of employing or studying or, um, you know, presenting magic. Um, that that would be the the the kind of angle in that I I would use probably with cheating, using a few follow-up questions as well. But, uh, yeah, understanding where people have struggled and encountered difficulties within the the the field of magic for me would be very interesting.

**Speaker 2:** So if you had this one question and you would ask them what, you know, what are what are some of the biggest challenges you've encountered in the field of magic, what are you listening for? What what are you hoping to learn from that?

**Speaker 3:** Um, I guess, struggling in moving from theory to practice. You're just knowing how an effect works doesn't mean that you can necessarily perform excuse me, Uh doesn't necessarily mean that you can perform that effect. You know, the processes of standing in front of people and successfully enacting a set of strategies and movements uh for folding them can be a very, very different experience from in particular reading it in in a book. Um, and that process of of learning on the job through sometimes hard one experience, getting getting busted, stuff not working, Um, and gradually learning how to perform and use those strategies in in a way that affects, is effective and falls people, um, really it's it's you know, learning magic from from reading a book is like trying to learn how to swim by by reading a book. You you've got to go out there and and do it in front of real people, uh to to really start acquiring the the the the street smarts of of how to employ the the the the theory in the real world. So, you know, stories around failure and people getting it wrong and what they learned and what they did differently, uh, would really be the source of uh things I'd be be listening out for.

**Speaker 2:** Oh, that makes sense. That makes sense. So, um, do you perform magic? Where where do you perform?

**Speaker 3:** Uh, underress, I perform or under the influence of alcohol occasionally. I am I I describe myself as a a student of magic. I I love magic, I I study it a lot. I have spent a lot of time working with magicians, hanging around with magicians. Um, but I I I my love of magic is in the uh underlying psychology of of of how it works. Um, I do perform. I have I've been paid to perform magic, um, but it's not naturally where where my interest lies. Um, primarily where I have demonstrated magic. I I've been doing that in the context of uh education to be to exemplify certain principles of deception or counter-deception. Um, so, yeah, it's been very useful being able to perform some magic to be able to fool military students in a in a classroom. Um, because if you're training them in counter-deception, one of the things you want to give them is an experience of being fooled. And it's very difficult to to do that in a in a classroom setting. But by fooling them with magic and then deconstructing the processes through which they were fooled, and in particular teaching them how to avoid being fooled, um, by, uh, magic or certainly less likely to be fooled by magic. Um, a lot of those principles translate into not being fooled in in other areas. So, the the the the clues to the deception that is underpinning a magic effect generically can be taken and applied into any area where deception is being employed to look for similar clues. Again, it's it's all relates to understanding the generic underlying patterns that enable deception to to work. So, yes, I do perform magic, but it tends to be in in classrooms for exemplifying and demonstrating certain principles rather than putting on shows. But underress I have done that as well. So.

**Speaker 2:** So one of the things you're highlighting that's true about so many domains is that, um, there's lots to learn to be learned theoretically and that's really important, but there's also this critical experiential component. So actually performing the magic yourself in front of other humans, or performing the deception, um, you know, there's a whole a whole another set of skills around that. And then there's also something to be learned from being deceived. From being on the other side of that.

**Speaker 3:** Very, very much so, yeah. I I I think the last point in particular, the sort of symbiotic relationship between deception and counter-deception. You know, if if I want to be the world's best deceiver, um, obviously I want to understand deception, but I also want to be hanging around with the the world's best counter-deception experts to to understand the processes they're going to use to catch me out. And I want to know what I'm up against in order to inform my approach uh for how I'm going to try and overcome those those methods and that body of of knowledge. And and similarly for for counter-deception, um, if my job is to catch people out, I want to go and spend time with the best deceivers understanding how they're going to fool me. Um, and that looking at the the the problem from both the offensive and the defensive perspectives I think is absolutely fundamental to informing best practice in in both of those areas.

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, but I imagine there's some challenge in finding those people. So when you study firefighters, firefighters are everywhere and and, you know, and and they are called firefighters, but, um, like, are, you know, who are deception experts? Or who do you who do you study?

**Speaker 3:** Well, um, I mean, one of the issues when you start looking at the generic patterns is that you can draw knowledge and understanding from any domain in which it's is practiced. I mean over over the years, I've have been very fortunate in being able to spend a lot of time with deception practitioners in in different domains. I've I've organized, uh, conferences on, um, you know, learning from other domains. So at, uh, when I was at the working at the Defense Academy, I organized a a military deception conference, uh, entitled learning from other domains and and brought in magicians, uh, conn artists, um, Hollywood special effects guys, um, you know, I've also had the opportunity to work with, um, yeah, immersive theater designers, prop makers, prosthetics designers, lighting engineers, uh, audio illusion researchers, uh, art forgers, art authenticators, um, you know, forensic archaeologists, uh, microbiologists, um, you know, spending time anywhere where people employ deception to shape the understanding of of an audience. You you can learn about deception from. So, um, because deception is everywhere, finding people that are are experts in some aspect of deception, even if that's not how they frame what they do, um, you can pick up hugely valuable knowledge from from all of these different areas. So it's it's not hard to saw in in my experience.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, it reminds me a couple years ago I was doing some work with uh folks that produce pet food, uh, and some what you're saying uh takes takes a very different context there but some of the same principles are are in acting. Um, so, so Simon, you talked us about the first two 15-year chapters. Uh, what what is the next 15-year chapter looking like? And uh tell us a little bit too about the blog and the book.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, um, so, I mean I'm I'm very lucky that uh at the moment so I I have the opportunity of of pursuing these these projects that uh I find particularly interesting. Uh and really my my goals are to to try and work in areas where I can hang around with interesting people and in particular where I can learn new new things. Um, there are areas that I'm I'm very keen to explore in in more detail. I'm I'm fascinated by things like immersive theater where, you know, creating these environments to bring people into and give them experiences that they would never otherwise be able to have and and, um, stimulating their understanding and their their the, you know, they're creating an emotional engaging journey for them. Uh, and I've been very lucky to spend a little bit of time working with, um, a couple of theater companies and also did a, a training course with Punchdrunk. Uh, spent a week with them learning how they design immersive, uh, experiences, uh, for people. That, uh, was very, very interesting. Uh, and I'm think there are lots of opportunities to bring knowledge of of deception and influence into those kinds of of applications. Um, I think sport is a very interesting area where there are very significant opportunities to broaden the the the repertoire of of how deception can be used in a way that's ethical and legal for gaining competitive advantage. And in many sports deception is a is a fundamental strategy that is used for fording the opposition, whether it's um, you know, dummy runners taking a a free kick in in soccer or the the the very pattern based um football American football plays that are used that rely on deception. My personal view is that, uh, we're really scratching the surface. Um, coming from a perspective of deception, there is just a huge opportunity for for broadening how deception can be used in in sport. So those are are very interesting uh areas that I would be keen to explore more. Um, for for me, probably the the the the biggest issue at the moment is tackling fake news. And I I think the storming of the capital three weeks ago is, um, a very clear indication of the consequences of of of, um, falsehood and and fake news. And when you think about that in the context also of things like COVID, misinformation, conspiracy theories, anti-vaxers, um, and, you know, genuine hostile states, uh, influence campaigns that we have very clear evidence of, there is just this tide of falsehood that, uh, is part of our our lives now. Uh, you know, beyond the the the the sort of, uh, simple examples that I was talking about earlier. Things that have a real societal impact. And I really think that there is a lot more that can be done in terms of creating a a a step change in things like media literacy, um, and, uh, yeah, it's it's it's it's a difficult area. At the moment, conspiracy theorists tell their followers to, you know, don't take my word for it, go out and do the research. Um, and those followers will go out and they will do the research and they will read up on a lot of stuff, all of which is confirming the uh the conspiracy theories. So how people make sense of the the the the info sphere, how information is presented, how it's handled, how it's, um, uh made available to people. I I think there's a a heck of a lot more that can be done in that space. Uh, the area of pre-bunking, uh, I think has a a lot of opportunities. So, uh, again relates to getting people better tuned in into how information can be used to to mislead, um, their essentially the their sense-making processes. There are some very interesting, um, developments in the area of educational games for countering fake news. There was a recent game that, uh, is a sort of multi- agency product that's come out of the US State Department's, um, global engagement center. And I think also the Homeland Security, um, cyber security, uh agency, uh, in conjunction with I know University of Cambridge were involved. It's called Harmony Square. It's a free online game that, um, educates you about fake news in a very engaging way where you you essentially play a disinformation officer that's going to create uh false information campaigns. And it centralizes on the role of emotion within information as a very engaging and persuasive way of affecting people's belief beliefs. So, those sorts of, um, things are are very interesting but a lot of them are not drawing from the large body of knowledge that exists about how these phenomena really work. I I think also opportunities for, sorry, I should also say that the, um, Harmony Square, there was an article in, uh, the most recent Harvard, uh, misinformation review, uh, online journal, uh, where that game has been evaluated and shown to reduce people's tendency to immediately buy into fake news. So there's, you know, some tantalizing evidence that these sorts of, uh, approaches have potential. Um, and, uh, I think it's also really good to to see the social media platforms are labeling and refuting fake news. Um, but my personal view is that there's a lot more that can be done by drawing from an understanding of deception and and influence more broadly to develop, um, way more potent approaches for for trying to deal with this this tidal wave of of falsehood. And all of this is really founded on properly understanding the phenomena, uh, and I think our understanding of sense making and decision making has a lot to contribute, uh, as well as an understanding of this symbiotic relationship between deception and and counter-deception. So that's an area that I think is, um, very, very, uh, open to bringing in some of the areas that I I've been spending a lot a lot of time working in and, uh, I'm I'm very keen to to try and make a contribution to to that that area as well. Um, yeah, and my my blog, uh, deceptionbydesign.com is really just a, uh, repository for for where I, uh, put some of my my thinking about deception. There are various, um, articles on there about, what deception is, how deception works, uh, the ethics of, um, deception, um, various applications, things like, uh, parasitic deception and and how deception is being used to try and fight malaria, for example. Um, there are a set of book chapters that, uh, I've been publishing over the last couple of years in a series of magic books called the shift where I've been looking at the relationship between magic and deception more broadly. Um, and it includes, uh, um, a an article on, um, why some aspects of magic do not translate into deception more broadly. Uh, people get very seduced by how, uh, interesting magic sounds, but there are some very significant limitations I feel in magic's ability to to generalize entirely. Um, and also have an article on there about, uh, counter-deception and the way in which, uh, magicians can use counter-deception theory to improve the the potency of their magic effects. So, yeah, it it's really just a sort of dumping ground for some of my my thinking. Uh, and the book is something that's been a a long time in in development. It's a, um, a book that attempts to both explain the ubiquity of deception, uh, that is all around us, but then looks at processes for making sense of deception, for deconstructing deception, for formulating deception and for countering deception using a set of of frameworks that are based on, you know, years of experience of of working in these fields, uh, educating and training people in in in these these areas. Uh, and, uh, the the the book is is finished. Um, Robert Hoffman very kindly spent a lot of time providing a fantastic, uh, review. Um, yeah, went through it with a fine tooth comb. And my subsequent editing process has take been taking a a very long time, partly because I've I've been, uh, drawn off and seduced by all these other interesting projects that have come up and I've been working on it in a very peace piece meal way and it's been a a very torturous and it is, uh, certainly at the moment an ongoing process of of editing the book. Um, but of course so over that time so much has happened in terms of particularly fake fake news, um, and recent events and also technological developments that uh I also need to be uh updating the book to reflect some of the the the the major uh things that are happening in the world of deception and how deception is currently in the world. Um, so the book is really much an ongoing process, but I'm absolutely determined this year to get all the edits and uh updates done uh and uh hopefully that uh will will see the light of day in the not too distant future.

**Speaker 2:** I hope so. That sounds fantastic.

**Speaker 3:** Hmm hmm.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, it it sounds really interesting and and really timely and um, I will be the first in line.

**Speaker 3:** Thanks.

**Speaker 1:** All right, we're going to wrap up with uh with one fun question. Uh, I have no hope for myself because I usually get these wrong anyway, but I feel like if I get this one right, I will have erased all my prior uh incorrect guesses because you are a professional deceiver. So if um if you tell us two truths about yourself and one lie, we'll try to guess the lie. And um, and if I can guess it against you, I I will I will redeem myself.

**Speaker 3:** All right, I I think the uh nation that those that can do and those that can't teach could not be better applied to to myself. I'm a terrible liar. Um, so uh, I don't know if I stand any any chance at all of um folding you but uh I I'll see what I can do.

**Speaker 3:** So, uh, in November 1989, I was doing some data collection on an exercise, an army exercise in Saltau in Northern Germany. And towards the end of the first week there, the Berlin Wall fell. And so on the the Saturday a group of us drove three hours east to get to Berlin to join in the celebrations. That's uh number one. Uh number two, when I was 10 years old, I entered the UK Cludo Championships that were held in London. And Cludo is the UK name for a board game that I think in the US is called Clue with uh Professor Plum and Mrs Peacock and Colonel Mustard. you're talking about the sort of murder mystery thing. Um, and in the the the face of stiff competition uh entirely from adults, I somehow made it through to the the the very final deciding game and there were four of us playing and uh it was sort of competition rules which are are slightly different. Uh, so you're actually scored and the the top three players were going to make it through to the World Championships in in Paris. And uh, unfortunately I came forth, which I I think is still okay for a a 10-year-old, but I narrowly missed traveling to Paris for the World Championships. And then uh the third uh case uh about two years ago, I was approached by a five-time Emmy winning Hollywood TV writer who wanted to to discuss working uh with him to develop a TV series based loosely around my career in deception.

**Speaker 2:** You want to go first, Brian?

**Speaker 1:** So, uh, yeah, so it was the Berlin Wall, 10-year-old uh, clue prodigy and uh a TV show based on my career. I think you're a terrific liar, first of all.

**Speaker 2:** Me too.

**Speaker 1:** Uh, but here's what I'm I'm going to go with the first one because that's one that you could have just made up based on a World Event. The others are quite personal, so that's that's why I'm hinging on the first.

**Speaker 2:** So I had the same guess. I, um, yeah, you completely seem like you could have been a a 10-year-old Clue champion. Um, and you have a fascinating life. So yeah, I'm I'm going with with number one is.

**Speaker 3:** Well, I I said I was a terrible liar and uh you you are both correct. Um, one of the the principles of of being a good liar is that um, you should try and make your your lies as close to the the truth as possible. And uh I very nearly did go to uh the the Berlin Wall. I I was in Germany on an exercise. Uh, and the Berlin Wall fell. Um, and uh, there was a a a bus that was being organized for all the the scientists that are out there were going to East Berlin to to join in the celebrations. Unfortunately for myself and a a couple of colleagues, um, uh the day before the Berlin Wall came down, um, we got talking to a a guy in in a bar who wanted to practice his English and um persuaded us to join him on the the Saturday for Cafe and Kuken, coffee and cakes. And um, in in lieu of anything better to do, we had agreed to do that. And so when the Berlin Wall fell and everyone else was going off to Berlin, um, we were socially obliged to go and drink coffee and and eat cake with this guy. And so I can say that I was in, uh, Germany, uh, when the Berlin Wall fell, but I didn't go to Berlin. I I was eating cake in a cafe. So, um, uh, it was it was close to the truth, but I I just missed out on it.

**Speaker 1:** Excellent. Finally.

**Speaker 2:** Okay.

**Speaker 1:** I am redeem.

**Speaker 3:** Well, thank you so much, Simon. This has really been interesting. Um, I think we could probably go on and on. Uh, but for today, I think we'll wrap up. It's really been great to talk to you.

**Speaker 2:** It has.

**Speaker 3:** Yeah, thanks so much. Um, really good to get catch up with you guys.
