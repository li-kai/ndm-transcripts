The Naturalistic Decision Making podcast with Brian Moon and Laura Melitello. This podcast series brings you interviews with leading NDM researchers who study and support people who make decisions under stress.

**Laura Melitello:** Welcome to the Naturalistic Decision Making podcast. This is Laura Melitello with Applied Decision Science.

**Brian Moon:** And I'm Brian Moon from Perigee and Technologies.

**Laura Melitello:** We are really excited today to have Von Tenn join us. Von is an assistant professor in strategy and entrepreneurship at University College London School of Management. He received a PhD in organizational behavior and sociology jointly from Harvard University and Harvard Business School in 2013. His work focuses on innovation and adaptability in the context of uncertainty, particularly the difference between risk and uncertainty and designing organizations so that they are innovative and resilient. He has worked at Google in California on Earth, maps, ads, and special projects including structured data infrastructure and lunar exploration. His work has seen him influence organizations including the UN Development Program, Stripe, government of Singapore, and the Carlyle Group among many others. His first book, The Uncertainty Mindset: Innovation Insights from the Frontiers of Food, was deemed a real contribution to our understanding of how experts combine artistic creation and business success by the late esteemed sociologist Howard Becker. His current work also focuses on even wider range of types of not knowing that we face. Welcome, Von, and thank you so much for joining us. We're super excited to have you here.

**Von Tenn:** Thanks for having me here. I'm very excited to be here as well.

**Brian Moon:** So, I was just truly floored by the uncertainty mindset, mainly because it touches on so many themes that we in the naturalistic decision community are interested in. And just to list a few of the most salient ones for me, it was, you know, dealing with uncertainty, rapidly developing high-performing teams, innovation. And I want to get to those, but first a little background. If you could tell us about your PhD work at Harvard and your interest in sociology in particular. This was the other value for me of the book and drawing connections between the disciplines. I'm something of a sociologist myself. So, tell us about your work at your PhD work at Harvard.

**Von Tenn:** For sure. So, I, I started out as a quantitative researcher. I came from Google where I was working on structured data before I left, and I thought that I was very interested in a lot of the, you know, at that time, not new but also not very mature world of very large data set network analysis. And then when I showed up at Harvard, I started taking classes with a bunch of sociologists who were very, very interesting. And some of the things that showed up in that first year was the realization that the really interesting problems of organizations and especially of organizations trying to do things that have never been done before, were things that you couldn't really count, right? So you couldn't really do quantitative sociology or quantitative analysis on these really interesting problems because the constructs themselves had not been developed enough to the point where you could figure out how to measure them and then after you measure them accurately, do the analysis on them. So, I started out as a quantitative wannabe sociologist and then I became a qualitative sociologist, and I think that's how the work that I've done sort of begins to intersect with what the NDM community likes because I was just hanging out in spaces watching people do things. And part of what qualitative, especially ethnographic sociologists do is we try and go in with as much of a blank slate as we can have, and see what recurrent patterns show up, see what assumptions we don't know to make but people in the setting make without even thinking about them. And from that kind of analysis of things that just appear to us as naive observers of the outside, we try and make sense of what's going on inside and feed it back to them. So, I think the methodology of the naive stranger coming in to observe all the weird things that don't appear weird to people inside the setting, that really is the foundation of almost everything that I've done, both in the book that you mentioned and also in the subsequent work that I've done after that.

**Brian Moon:** Awesome. It's so interesting because so many of the folks that we've talked to on our podcast are also converts, like yourself, but converted from some experimental psychology paradigm, right? So they were trained in experimental psychology lab studies and that sort of thing. But you're a convert of a different sort, sort of coming from quantitative work, very quantitative. I'm imagining at Google, but even when you started to get into your sociology work, making that conversion. I wonder if you could just talk about that sort of conversion for a moment and does anything stick out in your mind as sort of moments of aha where you sort of realized that you were heading down this path of conversion? Were there any big moments of sort of come to the gods of qualitative work?

**Von Tenn:** No, it's it's a good question. So you mentioned the late esteemed sociologist Howie Becker, and I actually had a chance to have coffee with him randomly. Like he used to divide his time between Paris and San Francisco. And I've always loved his work. I don't know if you're familiar with the piece learning to become a marijuana user?

**Brian Moon:** Yeah, of course.

**Von Tenn:** It's an amazing piece of sociological research that could not have been published today and was published, I don't even remember how many decades ago, but I I read it and I was like, this guy is a very interesting guy. And then he also wrote a book later on on visual sociology, which I'm a big advocate for. And I sent him an email at whatever email address I found on the internet, and Howie said, yeah, sure, if you want to come up to North Beach, you can have a coffee with me and we'll talk. And so I went up there, this was in my first year of grad school, and he said, you know, one of the interesting things that you will probably find out much later on is it's much easier to publish quantitative research because it looks like it's really rigorous and often is actually really rigorous as well. But all the really interesting questions seem to come out of places where we don't yet know quite enough to be able to count. And the moment he said that, I I think something really sort of clicked, right? Because when I was at Google, one of the things I worked on was a bunch of teams. Oh, I worked on a bunch of teams which were not formed by Fiat. You know, it was not like senior management at Google formed these teams to do brand new projects. They actually self-assembled. Like people inside Google found each other, they found that they were interested in the same things and then we collectively decided, hey, maybe it's worth pursuing these small projects. And when Howie said that, something which I've been thinking for a long time, kind of snapped into focus, which is there are dynamics that you literally would not know how to count, but as an experience of them or as an observer of them, you can detect. And often the things that you can count end up being the things that you try and control, you try and like make more of them or increase how prevalent they are. And the stuff that really seems to drive a moving of the needle, you know, especially like the formation of teams that decide to do something new that might become an innovative product. Those things because they are immeasurable, leadership or management really doesn't have a handle that it can pull, right? There's no lever it can pull to like increase the rate at which random teams form to generate new ideas and new products. And it was kind of at that moment. I I mean all of this is obviously retrospective meaning making, but it was almost at that moment, I think that I decided, I think I'm going to give it a shot and see if I can go just watch teams of people do things and see how that works out. See if anything interesting that doesn't appear in the literature shows up from watching teams of people engaged in doing a thing, do those things. That was probably about three quarters of the way through the first year of grad school where we were just learning all of these like, you know, old school theories and it was a a very refreshing conversation to have.

**Brian Moon:** That is a great story. Um, super jealous that you got to have coffee, but yeah, it's not always amazes me how folks like that in these different disciplines who are guru status, if you will, if they make themselves accessible and, you know, have that coffee, they can just change so many trajectories. And of course, they're not all willing or able to do that, but that's a whole another conversation. I do want to get to some of the topics that you've already started talking about and how your work has explored. You've mentioned the high-performing teams, but talk to us also about your perspective on uncertainty. We talk in the NDM community about managing uncertainty and for me that was a big piece of reading your book was was really getting to a perspective on uncertainty that I think was very interesting.

**Von Tenn:** Yeah, I will very easily talk your ears off about uncertainty if I'm not stopped. But I I think when I started working on the book, I did not realize at that time that I was going to become a researcher whose entire sort of research project is about uncertainty and the various forms it takes. But very quickly after going into the field, so the field for me, the field was a whole bunch of different sub fields, right? Like I went into a few different restaurant R&D teams, some of which are well known and I was just kind of kicking around, standing, I was a human traffic cone getting in the way watching what people do. And along the way, this sort of gradual sense making of what was going on, this like detection of an emergent pattern that becomes more and more solily identifiable. It became more solidly identifiable, and one of the things that became very obvious, especially compared to the kinds of teams that I used to work with in software development, was that every single one of the culinary R&D teams that I was working with had absolutely no trouble saying, we actually have no idea what is going to happen next or we have no idea whether or not this will work. And they did not have the sort of almost unconscious fear of failure that I associated with doing things that have never been done before, especially in sort of technology contexts, right? And so that was the first, that actually was the first thing I noticed about these teams that were very good at coming up with new ideas in food. It was that they were very okay with not knowing about something. At that time I didn't really think about the whole uncertainty and risk distinction, the one that Frank Knight makes. And as I looked at these teams more and more, I realized that this was actually a distinction between risk, which is quantifiable partial knowledge about the future and uncertainty, which is unquantifiable, not numerically quantifiable, partial knowledge about the future. And that eventually became the foundation of the book, trying to understand the way in which the difference and the explicit difference between risk and uncertainty, when recognized, changes the way you do things inside organizations, right? Like the very machine level kind of unsexy trivial seeming processes by which everyday organizations do everyday things, like how they actually hire people, how they actually set goals, how they motivate each other. So, the that distinction, the distinction between formal risk, the unknowns that are known enough to be controllable because they're numerically quantifiable and true uncertainty, the Knightian sort, which is uncertainty where you don't actually know enough to make it numerically quantifiable. That was a research area that I was very interested in for, I would say over a decade. And then in the course of writing the book and getting it ready for publication, I think something also changed about the way I think about uncertainty and risk. But maybe I'll just take a pause here just to see whether any of you have any reactions to that.

**Brian Moon:** My first reaction is I like how you stressed that word actually. That is a word that I think we should make more use of in the NDM community, because that is really what it's about, right? Especially this field work is going out and seeing how things actually happen and then describing what actually happened instead of sort of going in to verify this model that you already have in your head. So that's a methodological point, but yeah, why don't you just tell us about that second sort of insight you had?

**Von Tenn:** The second insight I suppose is that it is incredibly important to distinguish clearly between what is actually truly risky and what is actually truly uncertain, right? Like and again the distinction is just do you know enough about what you don't know that you can put a number on it? Do you know all the possible actions, all the possible outcomes, all the possible probabilities accurately and precisely connecting causation with the action with the outcome and also the valuation of any given outcome. You have to know all of those things for you to be in a world of formal risk. If you don't know one or more of those things, it turns out you're in the world of true uncertainty, Knightian true uncertainty. So, that was the first, I guess 10 years of thinking about this, more or less. And then as I was writing the book and getting it ready, it became clear to me that actually if you don't know one or more of those things, actions, outcomes, causation or values, it's actually not all the same, right? Not knowing about actions is not the same thing as not knowing about possible outcomes, it's not the same thing as not knowing about causation, it's especially not the same thing as not knowing about how much outcomes are valued relative to each other. And so, the big revelation for me, which happened probably in 2019 or 2020 as I was like revising this book and trying to think about whether or not it made sense, was the recognition that actually if we want to be sophisticated relators to uncertainty, not just managers of it, right? Like how do we relate to uncertainty that surrounds us? It became really clear to me that we need to understand even uncertainty in more nuance than just the distinction between risk and uncertainty. And so, this is the not knowing project, right? Because at the moment, and I'm very happy to talk about this, I think the words risk and uncertainty are so semantically overloaded in confusing ways that if we use either one of those, in general, people don't quite understand what you mean because they mean different things by them. I hate the phrase not knowing, but not knowing at least makes people realize that I'm not talking about either risk or uncertainty necessarily, I'm talking about some other thing and that's been useful even though the phrasing is quite unwieldy. That's the development, I guess.

**Laura Melitello:** Yes, and as the executive director of the Naturalistic Decision Making Association, I can appreciate unwieldy language that really struggles to drive home the point. So, yeah, we hear you on that.

**Brian Moon:** Yes, I do want to get to the not knowing and even your more recent work, but if we could take a step back to the uncertainty mindset, the other fascinating piece for me, and this is what you brought out so clearly, was just the process of innovation and creativity, which I hadn't really seen it described the way that you described it so well in the book, being because these teams you were observing in particular were sort of on the frontiers of R&D in food, you could sort of see that process play out, which I think is fascinating just as an opportunity to do that sort of thing is to see something play out like that. But you you highlight a few things, not the least of which is, you know, how the teams, how the team members gave each other feedback and what they gave each other feedback on, and how that helped them to understand their their own capabilities as well as others. And then how the organization itself, the organization set up to enable the innovation. So, I wonder if you just share for our audience a couple of those sort of counter-intuitive, to me at least, counter-intuitive ways that these organizations had set themselves up to enable innovation just to happen.

**Von Tenn:** Absolutely, I would love to do that because I think this goes to something which you mentioned, like the fact that actually whenever you are, you know, when you use the word actually, sometimes what you mean is, I went out and I surveyed 100 companies and they told me that this is what they actually do, or you've actually gone into a company or a few companies and you're looking at what people do, and you even as an observer inside the company, you still don't see everything that's going on, but you may be seeing things which if you are asking for a self-report, may not make it to the level of cognition that allows them to see that this is something that should be reported, right? So, to your question about sort of the methods by which people inside these teams did innovation and gave feedback to each other and received feedback from each other as part of that process. I thought was something which would have been impossible to find out from doing a survey, for example, of these organizations. So, a very quick sort of summary of of the thing and then I'll I'll say a bit more about the individual bits inside it. All of these R&D teams I was looking at in culinary R&D, they were developing new ideas in food, whether they were new dishes or new ingredients or new ways of putting a dish together or a new narrative for food and they all did it by what I think anyone who did any work in technology would recognize as a rapid prototyping process, right? So they would make a component like a sauce for a dish or they would assemble a dish and they would try it out. They would put it on a different plate, they would use a different sauce, they would cook it in a different way. And the idea is exactly in some ways the same as rapid prototyping. See if it works and if it does, build on it. I think the interesting thing about rapid prototyping is it is an opportunity to give and receive feedback, right? Because if you only do one big iteration, you work on this thing until it's perfect and then you launch it versus you do lots and lots of iterations on different parts or assemblages of the whole. The latter gives you many more opportunities to ask for feedback and then to get it. And the interesting thing about the asking for feedback and the getting of feedback is it not only helps you accelerate the rapid prototyping process by giving you more information about prototypes, it also has other effects on the team. Every time you give feedback to someone, what you're doing is you're expressing some informed opinion about what they've done in the context of what the team should be doing, right? And so, the moment you think about that context for feedback, it is a way for people in the team to not only express but also receive information about what the team is doing and what the team should be doing and connect that, you know, like the idea of a triple, to connect the action that they've taken with the outcome that they've produced, with some kind of evaluated framework in which that outcome, connected to the action, can be thought about in terms of the value that's put on it in the context of the team itself. And so, when I was looking at these organizations, the first thing I saw was rapid prototyping. And the way they did it was how they did rapid prototyping anyway. Like they make bits and pieces and they put it together and then they go through like a review session where people will just talk about what they've done. And this helped them move dish development along very quickly. But the other interesting thing that was happening was that it was also a way to test whether or not you're good at a thing, and it was a way of testing that wasn't testing the way we normally infer testing to be. Like it was not a high stakes, very formal test. In fact, it was so casual that for the first probably two or three weeks that they were doing it, I didn't realize that they were being tested at all. And it was only after I watched what they were doing and I realized that when people were discussing how to allocate work, they would often be thinking about whether they should take something or assign something, based on the results of something that previously had looked just like some feedback on rapid prototyping, right? So, if you think about what's going on, there is this constant sort of very low-level, very background, almost unnoticeable hum, and the hum is I'm making a thing, I'm going to get feedback for it and it's a very low stakes feedback process. It can just be, I walk over to this person's station, it takes 30 seconds, they taste it, they tell me what they think and because there's so much ambient context, you build ambient context very quickly, right? So these teams tend to form a collective understanding of who is good at what and why they are good at what, and they have empirical evidence based on some of these feedback sessions to support that when they say who is good at what. So, that was one really important part of it. It it actually helped them develop what I call open-ended roles, roles that are not fully defined, not just by assertion but by actually doing things and then those things that they've done, not just doing them but also having some concrete feedback that is seen and recognized inside the group to establish whether or not the things that they've done are good indicators of their ability to do whatever it is that they're trying to do. So, that was one part. The other part that was really interesting that took a long time to figure out was that there is something about style that is really difficult to talk about, but it's much easier to learn about and to teach about by doing things. So, I I think when I say style, I I'm actually referring to almost exactly what you think when you think about the visual style of an artist who has a well understood visual style, like a Van Gogh painting. He makes, or he made before he died, lots of different paintings, all of which were unique, but they're all recognizably Van Gogh paintings, right? Or Frank Gary as an architect, builds lots of new buildings but they all have a Frank Gary flavor to them, or Quentin Tarantino's movies, you know, all of these high-quality creative outputs, they are not only novel but also distinctive. And that combination of the two things is actually very hard to do and that's something which, even though we don't normally think of it this way, is what we value in consumer products and also in most products that we make, like even a law firm, when it's creating litigation, has a particular style which people will go to for that style because that style works in particular contexts. And everyone who's ever tried to teach someone else what this style is realizes that the most important parts of the style are not something you can write down. They are tacit knowledge that cannot be explicated, right? And then the question becomes how do you learn it if you are a new member of this group? And if you are someone in the group that is trying to perpetuate the group and grow it, how do you transmit it? And it turns out all of the methods that we, that at least I know of, that we've talked about as being good at transferring knowledge, they're generally good at transferring explicated knowledge, right? Write it down in great detail, give them a book. It doesn't cover this kind of knowledge. It is a kind of knowledge which is distinct, qualitatively distinct from explicatable knowledge. And going back to the feedback cycles, it turns out that you can also design, and again, this is very much machine level stuff, you can design the way you give and receive feedback, the context in which you give and receive feedback, to make this process of transmitting and receiving style relevant knowledge, much faster and more efficient. Right? I I'll just give you one example. A lot of the time, people who are inexperienced at giving feedback will tell people exactly what they think has gone wrong to produce this unsatisfactory result. It turns out that's not as useful as giving the person who has produced the unsatisfactory result a concrete exemplar of what a satisfactory result looks like. So, in the food setting, someone who makes, say a soup that is too salty. One thing that you could do, which a lot of inexperienced chefs would do, is say, you put too much salt, you should put in 25% less salt. The much better thing to do, it turns out, is to give someone or salt another soup to the correct level of saltiness and give it to them and say, this is how it should taste. And if you think about it, it's not just something that you can do in the food context, it's also something you can do in literally any context where work produces some kind of artifact. And the reason for this, I will call it a norm of feedback giving, to work better at transmitting tacit knowledge that cannot be explicated, is the concrete artifact actually captures that tacit knowledge perfectly. It captures it with complete fidelity in a way that your explicit instruction does not, right? So, there is also an analogy here to declarative and imperative approaches to programming and I think that may make more sense, I guess, for technically inclined people, but there are many, many of these little details that seem so trivial. Like should you do feedback in big groups or small groups? Does it matter? Some people would say do it in small groups because it's more efficient, but actually it's much better for learning if you do it in big groups so that people can have vicarious learning. They can learn from hearing feedback on something that they can also experience without having to give feedback at all, right? Even down to the detail of who should give feedback first, someone who is senior or someone who is junior. For power dynamics reasons, you would say junior person gives the feedback first, but you have to create norms for how they give feedback so that you elicit the right kind of feedback that forces them to attempt to explain why something is or is not good for the particular context. And all of these things, I think are machine level code, right? They are so small that they're usually thought of as trivial, too trivial for anyone important to really think about, therefore they don't really think about it. And as a result, there are some companies that appear to just magically be able to do these amazing things with teaching and learning, with innovation, with stylistic consistency in innovation, and nobody understands why. The reason why is it's all this stuff that is very, very far down in the actuality of what goes on every day in an organization.

**Brian Moon:** Yeah, it's all super fascinating and, you know, very counter to I think what is normally offered as guidance for how to do some of these things and how to how to be innovative. But the other, one last piece that I thought was really nice, was just the focus on, all this happens in the context of just doing the work that needs to get done, right? So it's not like we're setting apart these innovation activities, it was people still have to do the work that needs to get done, and that means you got to figure out who's good at what, and the teams were able to quickly come together. So, yeah, I I just can't recommend enough that folks understand first of all how you got to these findings because it was going out there and watching them happen, talking to folks and then seeing them actually perform, but then you saw it across organizations, and that's to me how sort of your pattern, your own patterns built about what was actually going on here.

**Laura Melitello:** Yeah, so I wanted to jump in there and ask about your methods. Would you just talk a little bit about your methodological approach and is it hard to make this happen in a quantitative world?

**Von Tenn:** An amazing question. So the method is very much old school ethnography, right? So what I did was I just, I went into a setting and I think the underlying epistemology of ethnography is fundamentally different from that of large data set quantitative analysis, right? Like with large data set analysis, what you need to do is you need to make sure that your data set is in some way representative, you've sampled properly, there's no bias that's contained in either missing or not missing data. You have a similar requirement in ethnographic data collection, but it's different because in the end, what you're really trying to do, or at least what I was trying to do with the data collection was to go into a setting that had a plausible form of generalizability and try and understand patterns inside of it. And when I say plausible form of generalizability, I'll just say this, it's that whenever you look at a case, right? And in this case, the case is, for example, one of these restaurant R&D kitchens. There are actually many ways you can think about how that generalizes because in some ways they are a case of a restaurant kitchen, in some ways they're a case of a restaurant R&D kitchen, in some ways they are a case of an R&D team, in some ways they're a case of a team. And the question for the analyst is always ultimately a subjective meaning-making one to decide which of these, I guess, immersions of the case you choose to pull out as the basis of your analysis, right? So, this affects the way the methodology works too, because what it does is it allows you to go into the setting and just kind of soak it up and observe, which is what we do as humans. We go into settings and we absorb information, sometimes we have prefilters, you know, we're not tabular rasa, prefilters that determine a little bit what we see in the first place by CNN, what we are able to observe and what we choose to make sense of what is most salient, but in general what we are is we are sense-making beings, right? We look for information, we try and make patterns and then we interpret those patterns in some way. And that's actually sort of, at least for me, that's the intention of going in as an ethnographer, to go into a setting where you explicitly say, I really am not sure what is going on here, I don't know, I'm going to try and figure it out. Okay, so, so that's as far as the sort of the, I guess the epistemology of it goes. The method was actually just, when you go inside and you're in a kitchen or an R&D kitchen, there's often not the resources that you normally have in normal organizational sort of data collection to be able to collect data in the normal ways, right? So some places there's no room for a laptop to always be there because it's a kitchen, right? So you don't have a laptop. Some places there is not even space for you to always be in the same place all the time. So you might have to be moving around because sometimes there's just no room. So eventually what I did was I became very opportunistic. There were some R&D kitchens where there was plenty of room and then there there was a laptop because it was normalized too. Everyone else in the space had a laptop. Other places where there was less room, this is where I took a leaf out of Howie Becker's book. I started taking photographs of the environment with a cell phone every five, six minutes. And so what would happen was I would always have a view from my point of view of what I was seeing. And the very interesting thing which I didn't realize until maybe two weeks into the fieldwork when I was writing up my first synoptic memo, was that having a visual memory of a time that is anchored to some scribble of notes helps you unpack memory that you did not have about that moment in ways that are completely unexpected. I this is probably different for every person, but since then this has become a key part of my data collection for anything, like if I'm trying to remember what's going on, I'm taking photographs. And for me this is a form of data collection which is becoming more and more recognized in various disciplines, sociology being one of them, but it's a thing, you know? Like we have triggers for memory and often in academia the trigger for memory is the one that is generally valorized, right? It's text. But there are other triggers for memory that are very powerful, like audio recordings of ambient sound, which we don't see used very much, certainly environmental ambient photography, we don't see very much, especially when it's anchored to your point of view. If it reminds me of the time where you actually were there, it's powerful. I can still look at my time series of photographs from fieldwork. At this point it's more than 10 years ago that I did it, and I can still remember things, which is cool. So, yeah, I I can talk more about the methodology if you like, but those were the sort of the high points that I discovered in doing it.

**Laura Melitello:** Yeah, so this is fascinating. I have never tried the photo thing and I was thinking I'm typically in environments where you're not allowed, you know, there's secret information or or whatever, but I would love to try that. And so let me ask how long did you spend in a kitchen? Was it an hour, a day, a week, or how much data did you have? How much soaking up?

**Von Tenn:** So I tended to try and arrange to spend days or weeks, you know, there were some places where because of time constraints from my end, I could only be there for a week or two, but I was there full days, you know, like we would start when they started, which usually means very very early in the morning, and then you would end when service actually closes down. Because sometimes R&D chefs will start early in the morning but you want to continue to see what the entirety of a day in the life of the restaurant looks like. And then you end up staying till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, right? So we're talking like more than 12 hours of time over multiple days, and you're just kind of, or at least I was, just talking to whoever had time and tolerance for me to be in their space. And then there were some other settings where I was there for three or four months continuously, and then I came back over the course of multiple years in some cases, working directly with them sometimes. So the the range was quite wide but it was rarely just a couple of hours for a day. It was at the minimum a week and a half of more than full days, more than full working days in the sort of office context and in most cases it was extended periods of time, multiple weeks to multiple months and lots of scribbled notes that eventually got transcribed into text documents that eventually got synthesized into longer synthetic memos that eventually got turned into bits and pieces of things that eventually turned into the book. And then thousands of photographs. And the photographs actually ended up being some of the more valuable things for capturing the actualities, the details are so trivial that you don't realize that they should be captured until it's too late to capture them in writing, but you see you see them happening in real time. For example, when I looked back at photographs from the first few weeks before I realized that feedback in large groups was incredibly valuable and I wasn't making notes about the feedback that didn't happen in large groups, I did not realize that almost all the feedback was happening in large groups. So that that was I think the photographs ended up being one of the most important pieces of data. I only realized it halfway through and then I I really doubled down on it.

**Laura Melitello:** Wow, very cool. So, I mean, you're doing serious ethnography. I I feel like I have many times been parts of what we call rapid ethnography where you just, you know, spend a morning somewhere. But even in that context, I sometimes draw like the layout of the room, not because I care about the layout of the room, just because I want to remember what it was like. So, anyway, the opportunity to really immerse yourself the way you did, that's cool. I'd love to do that.

**Von Tenn:** Yeah, I think even rapid ethnography has a lot of value, especially when you go in with the idea that a lot of the time, I think as Brian you said, people go in with the idea that they're trying to validate or get support for an existing hypothesis. And if you go into rapid or very, very short time frame ethnography with the idea that in some ways you don't know what's going on and you're trying to use the time that you have to get, to observe so that you can figure out what's going on, like observe and figure out being operational terms. I think it's still doable. The only downside of that kind of short window ethnography, I suppose, is that you don't have time to realize what you didn't realize you should pay attention to during the time that you had, right? So that I think only really is possible if you're there for enough time or you are familiar enough with them because you come back again and again, which is which is a downside, like it just takes too long sometimes, you can't do it.

**Laura Melitello:** Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think the NDM community often our primary method is these in-depth interviews. And then if we get a chance to spend a morning observing, some of the things people talked about just click in a way now that you've seen it that it never could have before. So, I am always advocating even for, you know, rapid enough, even a small observation is going to help you see things that they described but you just couldn't quite imagine until you actually saw it.

**Von Tenn:** Absolutely. I 100% agree on that. And I think it is often very difficult to get especially in a client context. It's hard enough to get research subjects or target organizations to understand why it's valuable, not only for you but also for them to have someone come in and spend a lot of time with them, right? Like the the value of a stranger looking at something with stranger eyes is enormous, but I think that value is not well understood, other than by the people who are professionally strangers, right? Like this group, I suppose. So, it's even harder to get clients, for example, to recognize that sometimes the only way you can figure out what is good or bad about your organization is by having someone come in and watch it for a long time who isn't part of your organization. I guess some people are better at convincing people about that than others. Like the guys from um Red Associates, Christian, very powerful, I think at selling that.

**Brian Moon:** Yeah, we had a similar conversation with him just about convincing clients that this is a worthwhile activity. And I mean, part of the challenge, of course, is that there's lots of other folks out there who have a ready-made solution and all they need to do is come in and tell you about it and they can move forward. So, those challenges are a whole another podcast to talk through, but I'm sure we could spend hours on that. I do want to get to your not just the not knowing piece, but also this idea of productive discomfort that you've been working on lately. What is productive discomfort?

**Von Tenn:** Productive discomfort is actually something that came out of the research on these culinary R&D teams. So, I mentioned before that the most surprising thing that first leaped out at me was that these teams were not afraid of naming the fact that they were not knowing what was going to happen next, right? So they could talk about it openly and they often did talk about it openly. They didn't like it, but they could at least talk about it. There was no sort of obstruction to discussion. And as I observed the people who were in these teams more and I observed how the teams worked more, the thing which I realized was that they were repeatedly putting themselves into situations that were slightly uncomfortable because they were slightly beyond their known range of ability. So, a great example of this would be the team that the whole restaurant team at Noma, which is this restaurant in Copenhagen and they decided, I think probably in 2011 it was, that having never put together a conference ever, they would put together a conference and also invite all the people that they most respected in the restaurant business, right? Put together a conference of a type that had never been done before and then invite all these people that they had a real reputational investment in preserving their image as being completely competent at doing something. And so, that kind of thing I would say is at the very limit of comfort. In fact, it goes well beyond comfort. And I think the recognition that what was going on there was they were consciously deciding to push beyond what's comfortable because they recognize that that represents a current limit, not an absolute limit. When you suspend your ability to know for sure that you can do something, what you also have to do is you have to suspend a lot of the things that get in the way of organizational change and individual and team learning, right? So, existing ways of working together, existing ideas of who should be on a team and how they should work, existing ideas of what roles should be. At some point when you're desperate enough because you are so uncomfortable with the idea that you are committed to doing something that you must deliver but you don't know how in the current configuration to deliver it. At that point, you know, this whole idea of like you unfreeze and then you do stuff to it and you refreeze again, I mean, I don't know how I feel about that, but this definitely does something like that, that discomfort at some point is productive. It unlocks the ability to change. And so, as I realized that this was going on, because I also noticed it in almost every one of the teams. Like all of them were doing this thing where they would commit as a team to doing something which was beyond their current ability and then learn how to do this thing, right? So they would build their capacity to do it. I realized that the reason why the people in the teams were able to do this was they were also doing it themselves. So they were committing to doing things that they couldn't do, that made them uncomfortable. And when I had a chat with a few of them, the ones I was closer to, they said, yeah, this was a practice that they had accidentally fallen into, not only in a professional context but in, you know, daily like outside contexts as well, right? So they would intentionally do things that made them slightly uncomfortable because it forced them to do things that made them slightly uncomfortable, which were new things that maybe let them to learn a new perspective or learn a new way of doing things or simply get rid of an old, potentially no longer useful perspective on things. And so, that's the genesis of this idea that discomfort can be productive, but there are conditions under which it is productive. It cannot be so uncomfortable that it causes sort of a breakdown of your capacity to do anything at all, right? It paralyzes you. It has to be done in a way that is volitional. It cannot be applied to you or imposed on you, you have to choose to do it yourself. And it also has to be progressive, sequential and habitual, right? So all those three things at the same time. You cannot start all the way at the most uncomfortable thing that causes you to collapse. What you have to do is you have to do it a little bit, like what we do with progressive weight training. You know, if you've never been to the gym before, you don't immediately try and lift 200 pounds, right? You try and lift something which is doable and then you figure out what your threshold is and you go over it a little bit. And you don't just go once, you go every week and every week you are pushing it up a little bit more and you don't skip too often, you have consistency. And what's going on is you're gradually building capacity to do a thing which you were previously not able to do and you see literally capacity going up, right? So we normally see it for things like physical things, like your ability to lift weights. But you also see it with the capacity to deal with the situations that you are uncomfortable with, that you don't like, that you don't know. And this is what these individuals inside these teams were doing, this is what the teams as a whole were doing. And so, this is a very long and circuitous way of saying this is what this deck is meant to do. It is meant to give you a tool that helps do this in a structured way. And the idea behind how it works came out of looking at how these people did it for themselves. And now that I'm using it and people are using it as well, it seems to work in this way too. I mean, there's probably ways it can be improved out. We're thinking about it now for some schools to use in in France where I am, but in generally, that's the general idea behind why discomfort can be productive, when it can be productive, and then how you can become better at putting yourself into situations where the discomfort is productive as well.

**Brian Moon:** Yeah, so you mentioned the deck, we'll put a link along with the podcast to the deck, but it's essentially a card deck of situations that folks might feel uncomfortable with. There's a theme around this entire conversation, which is you have gone from an organization focused on data and quantifying and getting certainty, or at least quantifying the risk, to trying to help people be comfortable in uncertainty and not knowing what's happening or going to happen and being realistic about that, but that is what helps people to grow and that's where we see innovation come out of. So, I'm just sort of struck by this dichotomy that you that you're presenting here early in your career, very much, you know, and that's most organizations are focused on. They want certainty, they want numbers, they want to see accuracy, they want people to have demonstrated competence. So all these approaches that we typically see, you're suggesting that these innovation teams did almost just the opposite of that. They put themselves in uncomfortable positions where they didn't know how to do something and then that's really what the innovation grew out of. So, it's pretty remarkable that you've been in both of these environments and been able to share with the rest of us what what happens.

**Von Tenn:** Yeah, it is, it is true that I've sort of gone through this process of seeing one side of things and then deciding to sort of focus a lot of attention on the inverse of the opposite. I do think it's less that it's not, okay, it's not so much that one or the other is good and the other is bad and that organizations should be only one or only the other, because I also don't think that's true. The reality is always more complex than that and the reality is what organizations need to do is they need to understand when the work they're doing requires this kind of slightly heterodox approach to management, I suppose. And when it requires the orthodox approach to management. And I think a way of thinking about it which I like to use is if the work you're doing requires uncertainty in order to work, then you're doing uncertainty work, right? And and what this means is if you need to have some sense in which you don't know what's going to happen next for your work to be successful. This means all innovation work by definition because if you knew 100% not only what the desired outcome was of innovation but also how you get there, it wouldn't be innovation anymore, right? So innovation by definition is the work that not only must acknowledge the fact that uncertainty exists, it is the kind of work that requires uncertainty to be embraced, we need to learn how to work with it and use it as a tool in order to do innovative things. The only sort of discipline in which this is generally recognized is art, right? If you talk to artists, even low-level artists will talk about this, but in all other domains of human existence, the only people who talk about it are the people at the very highest levels, right? So if you talk to Nobel Laureate physicists or you talk to the most amazing sociologists or the most amazing economists, they will all talk about how the new ideas always come from not knowing about what the new idea could be. So, on the one hand, if you've got a part of your organization that has to do something new, it has to learn how to manage the uncertainty work using uncertainty appropriate management techniques. And these are the things which I ended up talking about a lot. However, almost every organization also has work that needs to be certainty work, right? All compliance work is certainty work. All execution work is certainty work. All production and exploitation work is certainty work. For all of that, uncertainty work techniques are not appropriate. That's the domain of all of the orthodox management research that we've gotten about how to do optimizing stuff better. And I think the problem is that we tend to not be able to keep in our mind simultaneously the fact that there are two different parts of every organization's endeavor that need to be thought about and managed in ways that are fundamentally opposed to each other, but you somehow have to as a leader and as a manager bring them together and keep them working. Like there is that tension that will naturally always be there, and I think it's very difficult to keep them in your head together, right? Like I I find it very hard, that's why I focus on one of them, but if you are the manager or the leader or the CEO of an organization that both has an innovation mandate and an exploitation mandate, what do you do? This is a difficult problem. And I think Brian, you you mentioned before that there are lots of consultancies that will come to you with a pre-baked, very easy and legible, very easy to implement conceptually and legible set of prescriptions about how to run your innovation team or how to run your organization. Without naming names, I don't think that anything that is incredibly legible and appears to be extremely reliable in doing anything that is uncertainty work is actually reliable at all, right? It is some kind of false truth, it is some kind of cruel optimism of a sort to think that, but, you know, it is what it is.

**Brian Moon:** They're out there.

**Laura Melitello:** Yeah, I really like that distinction you made, and this is also one that you made in the book about sort of the routine work, the work that requires performance over time that is consistent and like you said with the restaurant business, right? Delivering a restaurant, right? Food and cooking and preparation, all that has to be fairly well aligned. You mentioned compliance though, and I think there's also a bit of a false truth there because when you talk to people who are responsible for compliance in the organization, there's a heck of a lot of uncertainty there and there's a heck of a lot of innovation, right? How do we meet this compliance but still meet our other goals? And so even in those areas that ostensibly sort of look like they should be managed through routine and continuity, there there's a whole lot of innovation and uncertainty sneaking in.

**Von Tenn:** So, just to say on that, because I I'm doing some work on compliance at the moment. It's absolutely true that if there is regulation of any sort that you need to comply with, there are parts of the act of compliance that are simply about doing what you've decided needs to be done and doing it conscientiously, not accidentally, not doing it sometimes. And then there's going to be a part of it which is exactly, you say, the creative part, right? Like how do you figure out how to thread the needle lawfully between the Sylla and the Charybdis of this particular set of regulations. So, I I work a lot with GDPR and it is particularly interesting that some of it is going to be, yes, just be conscientious about building your business model and running a business model that complies. And then another part of it is, yes, you can comply and still do interesting business as long as you do it in a particular way that represents a brand new business model. And the difficulty will always be when you've got people who decide that something which is naturally both certainty work and uncertainty work together is only one or the other. Because if it's only interpreted as uncertainty work, then you have crazy stuff that actually isn't compliant, and we've seen that happen over the last like year and a half or more. Or if it's only certainty work when it's actually both, then what you see is you see very boring implementations of compliance, for example, that don't take advantage of possibilities left by the natural ambiguity of language and regulation. And it's again, it's the ability to see that it has to be both rather than either, that's the big gap.

**Brian Moon:** This is all fascinating stuff that I could go hours with you on. We're getting near to our time though, and I want to make sure we get to this last question because it's the one that I had in my head the entire time I was reading the book and that is, can you give us the top three meals that you have had in your lifetime, having had the opportunity to go many places and eat I'm sure some interesting stuff. Top three, or if one stands out, we'll take that one too.

**Von Tenn:** I'll I'll just do one because the top three meals have actually all been at the same place. I'm also not going to name the restaurant because that would be challenging. So, it's a very small restaurant that some people would think of as a wine bar in the city that I lived in and the food has always been especially interesting because it is not revolutionary cuisine, right? So, it is not the kind of restaurant where the menu changes every week dramatically. What it is is it's the kind of restaurant where every year when you go to it at about the same time of year, the menu is more or less the same, apparently, but individual dishes on there have adjusted slightly, like just because the chef, who is almost always either cooking or doing prep, has decided that his palette has changed. He likes to use this vegetable a different way, wants to cook this a different way. So, the menu is what I always now want to find in a restaurant. It's an evolutionary, not a revolutionary menu. The entire restaurant is extremely small. It's not a multi-hundred cover restaurant. It's small enough that the entire team generally knows all of the regulars and there are many regulars, right? So they're they're regulars, if you go there on any given night that they're open, I would say when I still used to live in the city, there would be up to 25% of people that you would see as a customer there again and again. And that's a very powerful thing to notice about a restaurant because if they can have a menu that isn't just cheap, because many restaurants will have repeat customers because it's just the cheapest place to eat. This restaurant was not that, it was not expensive but it's not cheap, but it also didn't have a menu that was always different. And if you don't have either a cheap menu or a flashy Whizbang menu, you have to have something that is really, really good for people to want to come back, sometimes multiple times a week and this was it. And it was great. And all three of the best meals I've ever had have been at this restaurant. In fact, I have been to this restaurant more than any other restaurant anywhere in the world by a factor of 10. So,

**Brian Moon:** We will respect your professional courtesy to not give us the location, but

**Laura Melitello:** Yeah, maybe we can get it offline. Just kidding.

**Von Tenn:** Offline is, offline is perfectly, is perfectly fine and an introduction if you go as well, for sure.

**Brian Moon:** Oh, fantastic. This has been really, really interesting and I hope that the connections have been made for our audience between why your work is so well aligned with our interests in the NDM community and I hope that folks will go out and explore your work in detail and watch as it develops itself because as you mentioned with the deck and even with your consulting work, it seems like you're going in directions that we all need to be aware of and paying attention to. So, thank you so much for your time. It's really been an honor to talk to you and and on that note for the NDM podcast, I'm Brian Moon.
